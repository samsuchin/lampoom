First of all, congratulations. If you&rsquo;re an agent, you must have one of those rare faces that is completely forgettable. Normal eyes with perfectly centered pupils. Normal hair collected in a normal rattail. Really big mouth but your chin is also pretty huge so it looks normal. Ugly, but kissable. The perfect face. But to be a great CIA agent, you can&rsquo;t just be good at disguising yourself. You have to be invisible. That&rsquo;s why the best CIA agents are really good CIA agents who die and come back as ghosts.</p>\r\n<p>Being a CIA agent isn&rsquo;t all poisoning African dictators and throwing South American dictators out of helicopters. Sure, when the mission&rsquo;s on we have to get serious, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t like to hang out at the end of the day at bars and clubs, talking about how hard it is to keep secrets from our children. In fact, we like to say that most of your friends will end up being CIA agents, partly because if you make any other friends then a few weeks later we have to shoot them into space on an exploding rocket. But don&rsquo;t be afraid to make friends a t the FBI, despite what you&rsquo;ve heard about a rivalry. The FBI and the CIA are not in any kind of competition, unless you&rsquo;re talking about the bet over who can secretly kill the most innocent Americans.</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering what you can tell your wife. You can tell her pretty much anything, except whenever you talk to her you have to do it by recording a video where you are a silhouette and you sound like a monster. You should also probably start training her now to think that blood is something else, like some kind of red rain, because sometimes you will come home with blood all over your shirt. Also, every couple weeks we call her and tell her you died, just to keep things fresh.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t try to be a hero and take stupid risks out there; this isn&rsquo;t Mission: Impossible. Or rather, this is only like Mission: Impossible in that we can make anyone&rsquo;s face into a mask.</p>", "created_at": "2008-10-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": true, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Birthday Card", "art_work": 2, "magazine": 1, "writer": 93, "content": "<p>GRANDFATHER: Here&rsquo;s a card from me.

Unbeknownst to Arthur, Elton&rsquo;s been using the grail to feed his secret pet, which he tries to sneak out of the house in a pillowcase. Arthur catches him in the act and pulls the pet out, revealing a large dragon which chases him around and shrugs at the camera a lot. &ldquo;Yakety Sax&rdquo; featured prominently in this episode.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Episode 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>Arthur and Elton both develop a crush on a wench at the local gruel joint. They each try to win her affection, with Arthur offering her a spot as his queen, and Elton romantically telling her he&rsquo;s gay. Things escalate: Arthur and George&rsquo;s house becomes divided, and the two engage in emotional and actual warfare until the wench makes her decision. She likes them equally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Episode 3</strong></p>\r\n<p>The pair adopt an orphan boy, and begin parenthood by going to his&nbsp;first day of kindergarten. Arthur and Elton quickly become popular &ndash; amazing the kids with their chivalry and sexually-ambiguous living situation &ndash; and they become co-principals of the school. They hand the mantle of principal on to the orphan boy as a sign of their love. The school collapses in a day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Episode 4</strong></p>\r\n<p>Elton and Arthur try to sneak into a movie. While forming their plan Arthur does some cheeky one-liners, but Elton does way more cocaine than that. Elton sits on Arthur&rsquo;s shoulders and they wear a huge trench coat to disguise themselves as an adult. A child runs into the theater shouting, &ldquo;Help, I need an adult to disarm the bomb in the orphanage!&rdquo; Elton sees that the jig is up and reveals that he can&rsquo;t help because he and Arthur are not an adult.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Episode 5</strong></p>\r\n<p>Elton decides to&nbsp;fly to the big city to try and &ldquo;make it&rdquo;. Arthur tries to replace Elton, but&nbsp;finds it ineffective to hang out with inanimate objects or himself dressed as Elton. Arthur, determined to get his friend back, hops on Elton&rsquo;s pet dragon and boards Elton&rsquo;s plane in mid-air. The pilot sees the legendary king on a dragon and passes out after a very specific set of PTSD&nbsp;flashbacks. Arthur and Elton&nbsp;fight through the ensuing laugh track to get to the cockpit, and Elton mutters &ldquo;Elton ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; nowhere, baby&rdquo; as they&nbsp;fly into the sunset.</p>", "created_at": "2017-08-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": false, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 18, "fields": {"title": "Vanagon", "art_work": 8, "magazine": 4, "writer": 75, "content": "<p>Ever since I was little, I wanted a vanagon.

I too had great hopes as I was being born that<br />I would be a green boy. But as I looked down to my feet I was very disappointed to find that they were the feet of a very blue-boy, a dark blue boy at that, even under the florescent lights of the<br />supermarket parking lot. My parents hoped that, while born a blue boy, I would mature mauve then maybe even travel clockwise along the color-boy-wheel settling at a nice light-yellow boy.</p>\r\n<p>But as of writing this, I am still very much a blue-boy. I am prone to blue-boy things like crying and not being able to enjoy certain fruits and not having any pets and not being able to drink a beer in one whole gulp. Sometimes if I look in the mirror and really think big-green boy thoughts and say to myself that I&rsquo;m green like green pea soup I can see myself almost as a green boy, definitely a lighter blue boy.</p>\r\n<p>Every month in the mail at green boy houses come letters from the government with compliments like &ldquo;wow, has a green boy ever been as green as you!?&rdquo; and &ldquo;as a green boy myself, I am shocked by how like a fresh spring vegetable you are. You are as green as a really relaxed green frog that is sitting on some nice green moss.&rdquo; Us blue boys get passive aggressive death threats from our neighbors.</p>\r\n<p>When green boys go to the fish market they can get wild caught Alaskan tilapia while blue boys have to stick our hands in the ice and ask the workers if we can please have some farm raised Chilean tilapa. We blue boys are also the workers at the fish markets so we are actually making ourselves put our hands in the ice and beg ourselves for the farm raised chilean tilapa. This is self hatred and is unhealthy and just part of being a blue boy.</p>\r\n<p>Green boys get to go to dances with all the girls that they&rsquo;ve picked up and admire how much they look like a fresh-spring roll in the big mirrors at the Ritz. Their dates always know that the green boys will say nice things and that they will be a very handsome couple with the green boys because green is the color that is very complimentary.

But I am a very rich man.</p>\r\n<p>Day 5: At the Hotel Bar. A well-groomed Chinese businessman tried to tell me that capitalism</p>\r\n<p>involves a complex network of labor division, and there is not any one person who made my</p>\r\n<p>iPhone, and certainly not a child. I laugh along. &ldquo;I must seem so naive! Kinda like the child who</p>\r\n<p>made your iPhone&ndash; what&rsquo;s his name again?&rdquo; &ldquo;Guō T&aacute;i-m&iacute;ng,&rdquo; he said, before he could stop</p>\r\n<p>himself. Bingo.</p>\r\n<p>Day 7: The Factory. The place was totally empty. No employees, no assembly lines,</p>\r\n<p>nothing. &ldquo;Guō?&rdquo; I shouted, hearing only an echo. Then a small noise from a strange door. I opened it slowly, revealing a gorgeous study lined with mahogany and books. At a desk was a small boy, examining his handiwork with a monocle, making new dints here and there with a small chisel. He looked up at me and smiled. &ldquo;Have you come to give me a big thumbs up?&rdquo; I was dumbfounded. I extended two big thumbs upward. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I appreciate it.&rdquo; He put down his chisel and gazed out of his window. &ldquo;You know, I really am lucky. Not everyone loves what they do.&rdquo;</p>", "created_at": "2020-12-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": false, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 31, "fields": {"title": "Genesis", "art_work": 14, "magazine": 7, "writer": 49, "content": "<p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

Just floating there about three feet in the air. And God said, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; and there was something in his throat so he had to say it again a little louder. God saw that the light was good, and he called it &ldquo;day.&rdquo; The darkness he called &ldquo;nort.&rdquo; This was the first day. Then God said, &ldquo;Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water,&rdquo; and his assistant said &ldquo;Ok.&rdquo; And it was so, so good. Having accomplished his allotted one task per day, God declared that it was now the third day. Although he could fly, God could not swim and was embarrassed to constantly wear a lifejacket around his assistant. So he said, &ldquo;Let there be dry land and green vegetation upon it. I will call this vegetation &ldquo;nort.&rdquo; And it was bad because he had already named something nort. For the rest of the day, God sat around trying to think of a word that wasn&rsquo;t nort. After a long time he finally decided on a name for this vegetation: nort. On the fourth day, God created the sun and the moon to help keep track of time. For example, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, two-decades, and centuries. On the fifth day, God said &ldquo;Let the water teem with life and let the sky teem with birds and let the water teem with sky,&rdquo; forgetting the decision he had made earlier to distinguish between the sky and ocean. And he heard from a friend that it was good. On the sixth day, God brainstormed many animals and came up with fire ants, bull ants and humans. He created humans in his image and bull ants in the image of fire ants. He looked upon all his creations and saw that they were good.

I&rsquo;d like to begin by thanking those of you who showed up to this lecture. I guess the rest of your classmates decided they&rsquo;d rather spend Thanksgiving with their families! <em>(light laughter)</em> I&rsquo;m here today to talk about myths, and how I am living inside of one.</p>\r\n<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t need to have a PhD to say that human life and mythology share some common features. I say this all time and I am illiterate. Truly anyone can say anything, anytime. But rather than talk about that, I&rsquo;d like to talk about the time I was approached at a very young age by a hideous old goblin, who told me I could save my starving family by following him into the forest. Next slide, please.</p>\r\n<p>He had two holes where his nose should be, and scraggly white hair where his eyes should be. One touch of his wrinkled, leathery hands was enough to make you want to vomit, as I frequently did when he began to appear in my shower every morning for a month. You can see a close up of his fingers here, and here. You could call that fateful day when I followed him into his woodsy hovel my &ldquo;Call to Adventure&rdquo; if you will, and the subsequent twelve years I spent trying to escape his labyrinth my &ldquo;Adventure.&rdquo; Next slide.</p>\r\n<p>But just because I endured a series of trials and hardships does not make me a hero. Refugees and homeless people are certainly not heroes, for example. A hero is marked above all by good deeds. Here&rsquo;s a shot of me really just going to town on this centaur I had to fight in the labyrinth. Next slide. Ah, and here&rsquo;s a shot of me signing the agreement to let Schmekel the Goblin &ldquo;have his way&rdquo; with my first-born daughter every spring, in exchange for my freedom. The sucker let me go immediately after that.

There, this is me standing next to the centaur&rsquo;s dead body.</p>\r\n<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to argue that the patterns we find in mythology are universal and could be psychoanalyzed to reflect humanity&rsquo;s deepest desires, though because I started this lecture an hour late I&rsquo;ll instead just wrap things up with the quick argument that my experience was the one true Hero&rsquo;s Journey, and I am the one true hero.

Her face could make all the holy angels in heaven really really horny. Her shoes didn&rsquo;t match her dress. She came in frantically saying something about how her sister had gone missing after hanging around a &ldquo;bad crowd&rdquo; and she wanted me, the city&rsquo;s only private detective open past 5pm on a Sunday, to track her down. The girl had gone bananas&hellip; But maybe just banana enough to get me out my slump.&nbsp; Looked like my bucket of bourbon appletini tonight would be a double.</p>\r\n<p>I told her the only thing she had to fear is that I would find her too fast, or that she was already murdered. Either way I would need some time to get the facts straight and a stiff gin and tonic&mdash;shaken, hold the tonic. The girl&rsquo;s name was Bella Boscoe, and her sister&rsquo;s name was Stella Scoscoe, a real twisty gal who lived downtown and hung out at a dirty joint called &ldquo;The Punky Puss.&rdquo; I checked around and apparently she&rsquo;d been dating Slim Jim Jackson, a hefty fella who went by the name of &ldquo;Husky Joe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I walked into the club to be greeted by the stench of vomit, coming from my vomit-covered jacket.

I ordered a whiskey and vodka neat at the bar and inconspicuously stared at him unblinkingly waiting for him to make a move. He finally stepped out into the alley for a smoke, so I followed behind and once we turned off the strip, I fired two warning shots directly into his back.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Freeze, punk!&rdquo; I shouted as he dropped to the floor out of fear and intimidation. Then I questioned him for half an hour. He wasn&rsquo;t budging. This guy was good. But I noticed something in his criminal pocket.

Back in the olden times, being a feminist meant not wearing any makeup, not shaving your legs, and shaving your head in order to be more equal to bald men. Nowadays, it is also feminist to blow all the guys on the basketball team (I am one away from achieving this). People shouldn&rsquo;t call me a slut, but if they did, that would be fine with me, because of my feminism.</p>\r\n<p>One big achievement of my feminism is that men can be feminist too. Let&rsquo;s do a little thought experiment. Imagine a feminist. Did you imagine a man, or a woman? A <em>woman</em>, right? No. The feminist I was thinking of was a gay man. That&rsquo;s fucked up. Men can be feminist in lots of ways, such as being gay, working as a male nurse, and saying thank you after sex.</p>\r\n<p>Another part of my feminism is &ldquo;leaning in,&rdquo; and the main tenet of &ldquo;lean in&rdquo; feminism is leaning in so hard to the boardroom table at a business meetings that you repeatedly bash your head into the table, rendering yourself unconscious and allowing the men to have the meeting as planned without hearing the voices of women.</p>\r\n<p>True, corporate feminism only benefits a small, select group of women, but this is not a problem if you are a part of that group. You should demand to be treated so much like a man that you are then able to subjugate other women. As such, if you choose to have children, you should forget about their existences as soon as they are born and pass them off to a female caretaker of lower social status than yourself. Try and remember your children&rsquo;s names at least until they&rsquo;re seventeen years old, so that you can give their names to admissions officers when you&rsquo;re making the large donation that will assure them a spot at an Ivy League college.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe my feminism doesn&rsquo;t sound so great. But just remember, it <em>is </em>great. And even if it was not, it&rsquo;s the best that I have, and also gender is made-up concept which does nothing but limit the range of human possibilities, and also all theoretical discussions are irrelevant and futile given that we live in a Matrix-style virtual reality in which certain unknowable godlike forces determine what we take to meaningful or even existent at all.</p>\r\n<p>This being said, the key platform of my feminism is these 100 issues:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Emergency contraception.</strong> Plan B should be renamed Plan A.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Body image.</strong> Women can come in all shapes and sizes, like pear, apple, pineapple, inverted triangle, helix, small square, tallpointy, backwards, sconce, scone, moan, pone, and those are all of them. Advertisements set an unrealistic standard for women&rsquo;s bodies; for example, when I see an ad for a sleek car or a silver watch, I think to myself, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I could look like that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Telling women to smile.</strong> Whenever I get my photo taken, people tell me to smile. As a feminist statement, I always stick my tongue out and pretend to choke to death as the picture is being taken. This ruins every photo that I am in. It&rsquo;s so unfair that there aren&rsquo;t any photos of me in which I am not pretending to choke and die.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sex.</strong> Sex is power, power is electricity, electricity is when a charge is placed in a non-zero electric field whose magnitude is given by Coulomb&rsquo;s Law, and&hellip; I lost track of where this was going.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Representation.</strong> It is so important to see women around you. However, I almost never see other women, especially when I&rsquo;m standing alone in the middle of a large cornfield. Why are all scarecrows men? When I turn on the television, I never see women; I only see static, because I haven&rsquo;t paid my cable bill in months. However, I can tell from reading old copies of TV Guide from 2002 that women are only offered certain roles: the hot sidekick, the hot love interest, the hot crazy girl, the hot nerd, and the hot old crone feeding pigeons on the street who appears in the background in one scene. Women should be able to play whatever roles they want, especially if that role is stuffing their clothing with hay and standing in a field for 24 hours a day to ward off birds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abortion.</strong> I know that as a feminist, I&rsquo;m supposed to support abortion and get as many abortions as possible. But do I have to like it? To be honest, I feel kind of weird about impregnating myself every month, only to get an abortion the next. Six abortions a year (seven on a leap year) takes a toll.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mansplaining.</strong> Whenever I go to Planned Parenthood to get my free abortion, as was promised to me by the Founding Mothers, the male doctors always says, &ldquo;I think you are getting too many abortions.&rdquo; Then when I plug my ears and scream unceasingly for as long as I can, the male doctors are always interrupting me, saying, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hold her down!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gendered toys.</strong> Why do boys and girls need different toys? When I was a kid, my brothers all got chemistry sets for Christmas, while I got no gifts and instead fashioned a small doll out of loose hairs I gathered from the floor. It kept falling apart. I think anyone could play with that toy, and grow up to be the accomplished chemist I am today.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gendered soaps.</strong> Why do men and women need different soaps? When I was a kid, the only soap I used was thrown to me in a bucket as I was kept in a very deep hole.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wage gap.</strong> Every time I make $1, I immediately deposit it at the bank. After I hand it over, I have no idea where it goes, and I have no money.</p>\r\n<p>I know that we said there were 100 issues facing women today and I have named 10, but this, in itself, is an important lesson about being a woman: always exaggerate how bad it is, or else no one will listen to you</p>", "created_at": "2020-12-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": false, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 41, "fields": {"title": "My Trip to Cleveland", "art_work": 16, "magazine": 8, "writer": 87, "content": "<p>I&rsquo;m going to be honest with you, reader&mdash;my sophomore fall didn&rsquo;t get off to a great start. Sure, I had a few things going for me: a n+1 suite in Adams (the &ldquo;Adams of the Quad,&rdquo; which is Pfoho), an early admit offer from the Porcellian Club, the healthy sex life I had maintained since middle school, and a regular brain with no learning disorders. But still, I felt like there was a gaping void in my life that could never be fulfilled, no matter how many drugs I took away from friends who were trying to stay clean or how much meaningless sex I saved women from by being an incredibly selfless lover.</p>\r\n<p>Suffice it to say, I was depressed, and since suicide wasn&rsquo;t an option given my fear of death, I knew I needed to find some kind of cure. So in order to overcome my death-phobia, I turned to Eastern philosophy, but found the concept of reincarnation even scarier than the already extremely terrifying idea of going to heaven. Therefore, without the comforting certainty that death would be the end of all existence, suicide remained something I could only watch Pennsylvania State Treasurer Budd Dwyer (R-PA) do on YouTube or in the hundreds of flip book animations I had drawn.</p>\r\n<p>So I began to see a psychiatrist, and after a few months of going out with her, I made an appointment with an analyst. While some people may dislike the idea of paying $200 to lie on a leather couch while some quack with a clipboard administers electroconvulsive shocks to your body whenever Dr. Milgram orders him to do so, I actually found it pretty helpful. For example, when I told my analyst about my fantasy where I walk into Sanders Theater with a fully loaded AR-15 to deliver a lecture on how to disarm an active shooter, he said it was just an expression of my resentment towards my father, who, back in the 80s, became the first &ldquo;good guy with a gun&rdquo; after he shot John Lennon.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, my analyst and I decided that it would do me some good to take a break and just get away from it all, so I applied to study abroad in Paris. But boy, did I feel stupid when I found out that, instead of applying to study in Paris, <em>France</em>, I had accidentally joined an ISIS training camp in Abu Kamal, Syria. Luckily, after only a week of training, I was sent home when a camp counselor caught me drawing a cartoon of Muhammad getting his dick sucked while I was <em>in the girls&rsquo; dormitory after lights out.</em></p>\r\n<p>As luck would have it, my flight back to Boston was hijacked by terrorists, who wanted to replicate the horrors of 9/11 by crashing the plane into a field in Pennsylvania. Luckily, I was able to overpower the terrorists and redirect the flight into the Pentagon.

I pulled up next to him. &ldquo;You know how many of these bad boys exist?&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo;, he replied. &ldquo;One million&rdquo;, I said. Referring to my Chevrolet Impala. &ldquo;Guess you could say I&rsquo;m one in a million,&rdquo; I told him. That&rsquo;s when George punched me, fracturing my jaw and causing me to speak with a lisp the rest of my life.

I love that man.</p>\r\n<p>I got to know George pretty well over the next few weeks as I sued him for medical bills. I dropped the assault charges though, because that was a hell of a left hook.

I had to perform this surgery to finish my medical school education, which is in my opinion the mark of a true man. On my birthday, father gifted me his old whip, signifying that he was going to retire and I would take over the family business of being a dominatrix. The whip was 100% human leather, which is to say that humans made it, out of cow leather.</p>\r\n<p>Later, I met my wife at the local general store, where I was buying extra-small condoms and she was buying one huge dental dam. I knew our relationship would never work out, because of the differences in our interests and races. She was a Native American, and I was a racist. You have to understand that this was a different time when everyone was intolerant, so for me to have been considered a racist back then meant I was extremely, extremely racist.</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, my wife didn&rsquo;t like how I always called her &ldquo;Indian,&rdquo; telling me that the proper term was &ldquo;Ashkenazi Jewish.&rdquo; I knew my father would never approve of our marriage, as he did not believe straight couples should marry until everyone had the right to marry. Sure enough, our romance soon ended after she died of dysentery. But not immediately afterwards.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, in those days, my home was on the range, and my house was repossessed by the bank during the Asian financial crisis of 1997. I lived in Kansas at the time; this is just to give you some temporal context. I worked during the day, and at night I cut loose at my favorite watering hole: a big pool of dirty water by the broken Exxon pipeline. All in all, I&rsquo;ve loved being a Cowboy, and I especially loved bringing the Super Bowl trophy to Dallas in 1972, as a deliveryman.</p>", "created_at": "2020-12-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": false, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 52, "fields": {"title": "Bus Driver", "art_work": 20, "magazine": 10, "writer": 101, "content": "<p>Uh oh.

All our sheriffs died last night.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by acknowledging the empty podium next to mine. As you all know, this child-sized plastic podium belongs to Sheriff Sharif, my second in command. Sadly Sheriff Sharif is not with us today &ndash; he is observing the Islamic sabbath after all. This is very unlike all the other sheriffs who were torn apart by a train last night.</p>\r\n<p>This train entered the town at approximately twenty-two hundred &ndash; and that&rsquo;s pretty heavy for a train if you ask me. I&rsquo;m not sure how it made it past the anti-train security we installed last year. Somehow it plowed through all 20,053 damsels tied up on the tracks, 1,085,768,231 damsels dressed as scarecrows, 9,999,999,999,999.97 damsels armed with water bottles to spray at the train&rsquo;s whiskers, and the 3 <em>Old Man Damsel&rsquo;s Damsel Emporium</em> franchises that we erected on the train tracks. At this point I should say that all the town&rsquo;s women are also dead.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the six days it took for this evil train to sneak past our security, the sheriffs wasted no time getting to work &ndash; after all somebody had to enforce our Jim Crow laws. Once the sheriffs were back on the street all seemed at peace, what with the women gone. They couldn&rsquo;t have possibly imagined the event that would rock our town and destroy the rule of law: the passing of the Civil Rights Act. Thank God that turned out to be a big prank and the sheriffs quickly caught the high schoolers responsible for it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little did they know that those high schoolers were actually little train cars, which assembled into a larger train car, which called up a few train car friends and combined into a larger train, which was part of an even LARGER prank by the rival high school. The sheriffs arrested these hoodlums too, and it&rsquo;s comforting to know how dedicated they were to the law before being plowed over, internally decapitated, dismembered, re-membered, dismembered again, and having their skin and sinew be twisted and ripped off by a hellish train at the conclusion of a large battle, metaphorically speaking.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sheriffs decided to visit a bar in our neighboring town to celebrate the imprisonment of all those children. The next train heading there was fiery, gnarled, and covered in the blood of millions of women, as a result of our town&rsquo;s poor train maintenance. They instead boarded the train after that which was the evil one. This was the last time they were seen alive, as shortly after their trip began they were struck by another unrelated train and quietly passed away. Sheriff Williams was the only survivor, but this morning, after a long battle with cancer, he was shot to death.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things may seem dire, but know that we will get through this tough time, and the law will always live on in our town. That being said I have just been informed that Sheriff Sharif is dead. Thank you all for coming. God bless.

I expected fat camp to just be a bunch of fat kids, but it was actually just six fat kids and one <em>really</em> fat kid who bullied us for being fat. I remember we once took a canoe out into the middle of the lake and it sank, because we were so fat that we drilled holes in it out of anger.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, we would get on the bus and take a field trip from our cabins (a two minute walk from the lake) to the lake. Lazy, perhaps, but we hated walking because we each had siblings die in wars, where they walk a lot. The lake was awesome, but we hated our rivals across the lake, the rich kids at &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; camp.</p>\r\n<p>My summer love was named Mandy, and she was the most beautiful person I had ever met at fat camp that summer. She and I would lay on the grass all night, just looking at the stars and pondering whether we would be able to get back up from the laying-down position. One time we tried to have sex, but we got caught by a religious counselor who said &ldquo;Ewww don&rsquo;t do that I&rsquo;m religious!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As visiting day approached, we worried our parents wouldn&rsquo;t recognize us because we had lost such a significant amount of love for them. My parents used to ask if I &ldquo;felt more comfortable in my body&rdquo; which made me cry because it reminded me of how limited I was by my physical body in this mortal plane. After my parents left I just kept doing my thing, being fat.</p>\r\n<p>Though it was sad to leave at the end of the summer, the camp director always said her reassuring catchphrase, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to get fat again for next summer!&rdquo; We all laughed, and it kept a smile on our faces as our parents drove us back home to fat school.</p>", "created_at": "2019-03-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": false, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 75, "fields": {"title": "Texting on My Laptop", "art_work": 26, "magazine": 13, "writer": 72, "content": "<p>Me: Hey Sarah</p>\r\n<p>Me: Hey</p>\r\n<p>Me: Hey Sarah</p>\r\n<p>Me: Hey Sarah, sorry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Me: I didn&rsquo;t realize hitting enter on my keyboard would send a message instead of starting a new line.</p>\r\n<p>Me: I&rsquo;m on my laptop and I&rsquo;m&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Me: texting</p>\r\n<p>Me: I hit enter again.</p>\r\n<p>Me: Fuck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Me: Fuck me.</p>\r\n<p>Me: I hit enter&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Me: again.</p>\r\n<p>Me: ********************I hit enter again.

We tried doing some preliminary x-rays on her but we couldn&rsquo;t because they don&rsquo;t make satellites that big. We managed to do an MRI, but when we hung the images up they fell off the wall and through the floor. She had a terrible fever but we couldn&rsquo;t get her into a cold bath since SeaWorld was closed. She then fell into a coma, and broke it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>-Jesus, Doc, I can&rsquo;t believe how much she suffer-</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>-Her left hand started developing some very troubling hives, so I told the nurse to walk around and check the right hand, and she&rsquo;s still walking. She eventually snapped out of the coma but didn&rsquo;t regain full control of her body for some time since she she has to wake up in sections. We found a swimming pool to bathe her in and added just a drop of water, but she overflowed it and took out the cancer wing. This freaked her out and she escaped towards the city, where the police and military fired at her &mdash; though it was ineffective since they don&rsquo;t shoot in panoramic. I chased her in my car and she charged at me, but when I tried to swerve around her I ran out of gas. I leapt out of my car and climbed up to her head to try and tell her to stop but when I got to the top my ears popped so hard I forgot where I was. What finally did her in was when she tripped on a dent in the ground that her shadow made and she fell and bonked her head on a plant. We thought it appropriate to give her a last meal, but when we asked what her favorite food was she said &ldquo;seconds&rdquo;. She then gasped her last breath and accelerated global warming by 175 years.

First, a little bit about me. My unrelenting passion for children&rsquo;s theater began when I was cast in the double-role of both Dorothy and the Tin Man in my synagogue&rsquo;s youth theater production of <em>The Dorothy and Tin Man of Oz, The Timeless Tale You Know And Love but It&rsquo;s Just Dorothy and the Tin Man.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>As I delivered my last line: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place like home, but I&rsquo;m from Kansas and I&rsquo;m also assembled from used car parts,&rdquo; I clicked my bedazzled slipper three times against the insulation tubes and packets of reflective Capri-Sun pouches duct-taped to my other foot. I was struck by the realization that <em>youth theater was my home.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>You see, I grew up in a theatrical family. Theater runs in my blood, like sickle-cell anemia, and shards of insulation tube, and other people&rsquo;s blood, which reminds me how truly touched I am to see you all are here.</p>\r\n<p>My mother was a playwright best known for the &ldquo;fictional&rdquo; musical: <em>The Dorothy and Tin Man of Oz, The Timeless Tale You Know And Love but It&rsquo;s Just Dorothy and the Tin Man. </em>Perhaps that rings a bell. You may recall how the concept was stolen and made into a clearly-plagiarized major motion picture, <em>Annie Get Your Gun, </em>based on the scene in <em>The Dorothy </em>where Dorothy has a gun.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other memorable scenes include when Dorothy and the Tin Man skip/clank down the yellow brick road, when Dorothy and the Tin Man swim/sink in the Emerald City lake, and when Dorothy and the Tin Man realize that they will die as they lived: solely in the imaginations of myself, my mother, and our audience member.</p>\r\n<p>The most challenging scene, logistically, was the one with the flying monkeys. That&rsquo;s because there were no flying monkeys, because the only characters were Dorothy and the Tin Man. This would have complicated the plot but thankfully the way my mother wrote it there was no plot.</p>\r\n<p>Another scene I struggled with was the sex scene, which really messed with my head. I&rsquo;ve been aroused exclusively by steel tubing and electrical wiring, lamp posts, toasters, refrigerators, gates, pennies, tanks, cars, pots and pans, saxophones, dental oh my god yes, dental, oh, god, yes, mm, aaahh dental scrapers- bike frames, pencil sharpeners, guitar strings, industrial castings, and steel wool my entire life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kids, this has been a difficult decision. But I&rsquo;ve decided to cast myself as the Tin Man and Taylor can be Dorothy. Let&rsquo;s begin some method acting.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, I appear to be lacking a heart.&rdquo; Ok Taylor, come over here.

Sigh, Hamish said aloud instead of sighing.&nbsp; He knew the drill. Girl from Bumfucksville, Manhattan with a winning smile and a folder full of <em>Naruto</em> fanart wants to be a star. Greases a few palms, offers to clean up the grease for a price, and before you know it she&rsquo;s fucked her way so high up the Empire State you&rsquo;re bringing <em>her </em>the Alka Seltzer.

Hamish looked out the window and spat at his reflection. The window was open, and the window cleaner looked really offended. He spun his chair around so he was facing the girl and spun around a second time for fun. &ldquo;The pictures, toots. The silver screen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, duh. Movies, yeah. Just call them movies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>He took a bite of his cigarette. Truth is this girl wasn&rsquo;t half bad. Hair like shiny rope, nostrils you could fit a fist into, extra long tits, and an enormous, freakish mouth. Like her mouth was for real so big. He sat there looking at her for ten, fifteen minutes, and decided that he&rsquo;d give her the job after all. &ldquo;OK, this is a paper mill. We make paper. Not movies. Sorry.&rdquo; He tipped her a tootsie roll wrapper for her time, and just like that, she was gone.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Another day, another dollar in the swear jar.</p>\r\n<p>Hamish stared out the window, and thought about really sad things, like global warming and the fact that the girl had left. She was a rare dame: a desert flower, and flowers don&rsquo;t just grow on trees. And now she was dead, probably. &ldquo;Hi, excuse me,&rdquo; she said, alively. &ldquo;Can you unlock the door?&rdquo; Hamish got up from his chair, and pushed her out the window.

There are tears streaming from his eyes. Paul doesn&rsquo;t move, his expression vacant. The pub owner pulls the trigger &mdash; Paul takes the shot in the chest. Paul rips off his bloody dress shirt and whips it at the shotgun, pulling it from the grasp of the pub owner. Paul throws the shotgun at the pub owner with all his might, sending him flying back into a wall and pinning him to it.

If he had his way, he would live and die in Cody. Maybe he&rsquo;d work at the post office with his dad. Or at the hospital with his mom. His dog would be dying soon &mdash; surely he would adopt and care for at least one more. He would probably marry someone he went to high school with. And he already had friends. He didn&rsquo;t need another one.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Enter Bradley. Bradley always had a deep hatred for Nate. He was never sure why he held this hatred &mdash; the only thing he was sure of was that he wanted to make Nate hurt. From the age of four, Bradley had been conceiving of the perfect prank &mdash; one that would forever ruin Nate&rsquo;s image in this town that he would never leave. After 14 years of intense planning, Bradley&rsquo;s prank was finally complete. It begins with Nate stepping on a bear trap whose teeth have been replaced with sponges covered in bear pheromones (this will be important later). After Nate&rsquo;s leg is caught, a spring activates from beneath the bear trap, catapulting Nate out of his clothes and into a helicopter waiting overhead. The interior of the helicopter is covered in banana peels, causing Nate to slip around and look like an idiot. If the sight of Nate repeatedly slipping and flailing his arms isn&rsquo;t funny enough, then the pilot and co-pilot and full studio audience in the helicopter are dosed with laughing gas so they can get really high and have a great time regardless. After a safe landing, Nate slips one more time then regains his footing and exits the helicopter. A team of NASCAR pit mechanics sprints out from cover and slathers Nate in cashew butter &mdash; at which point a swarm of dogs are dispatched to his location, all of them geriatric and fully missing their teeth. The dogs use their soft wet gums to eat the cashew butter off of Nate, revealing a poorly-spelled Chinese tattoo the NASCAR guys put on him which says &ldquo;kickflip pizzazz bastard&rdquo;. This is the point of no return &mdash; if Nate hasn&rsquo;t been humiliated enough to continue, then Bradley, observing all of this from a nearby bush, will activate a shotgun aimed at his own chest and end it all, his life&rsquo;s work having been worthless. If the prank continues, then Nate is shoved into a van. He has a paper bag put over his head, his crotch forced to an open window so his flaccid penis flaps wildly in the wind. The paper bag has a silly face on it. Nate is brought to the high school football field, where he is placed face-up on a mattress. The Viagra that was infused into the cashew butter and absorbed through Nate&rsquo;s skin is finally taking effect, and he has the hardest erection of his young life. The whole town is watching from the bleachers as the mattress contracts and retracts in such a way that it forces Nate&rsquo;s head into his crotch and back, making him suck his own penis for 3 hours. The elderly dogs, quite erect from the same cashew butter, rush the field in the middle of this and hump holes into the mattress, causing it to short-circuit and contract even faster. Afterwards everyone laughs because the bear pheromones from the bear trap were just bear pee, and now Nate smells.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Tomorrow the boys graduate from high school and go their separate ways. Justin has one last chance to befriend Nate, and Bradley has one last chance to humiliate him. Let&rsquo;s watch.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />&ndash; Hi Nate!

Hats invented hats.</p>\r\n<p>See, Randolph was sunbathing by the pool, the skin on his face all burnt and crusty, and suddenly, a thought crossed his mind &mdash; do some dogs need glasses? After he determined there was no conceivable way dogs needed glasses, he realized humans have been exposed to sunlight for several years. So he invented sunscreen, which failed spectacularly.</p>\r\n<p>Randolph had to think of something less creamy. Baseball caps were around, but they were exclusively for people who played indoor volleyball. So Randolph went to the patent office with the idea for an inclusive hat, but he forgot it was a Sunday. On Sundays, the patent officers deny patents to the Portuguese. Randolph tried again, but they <em>still</em> denied his patent, even though he waited seven days.</p>\r\n<p>Randolph invented hats a few years later to protect himself against bear attacks. Well, that didn&rsquo;t really work since when he went hiking in the woods, he forgot to wear his hat. A few broken fibulas couldn&rsquo;t stop Randolph from inventing, though.

He dressed in the same outfit he always did when he went in for a job interview: a plain white button-down shirt with 5 buttons and a pair of khaki pants with 2 leg holes. He brushed his teeth for exactly 44 seconds and fell down the stairs exactly twice. Nothing, not even a set of jagged stone stairs covered in glass and poison, could bring him down today; he had a chance at his dream job: an accountant.</p>\r\n<p>Arthur arrived at the offices of Reid Thornton Accounting at 99 Boylston Street 10 minutes early. If his professional tennis player of a mother had taught him anything it was to arrive early and how to play tennis. He took the elevator to the 19th floor of the tall glass building, and a friendly attendant informed him that Reid&rsquo;s office was the third one on the left. Arthur approached the door, inhaled, exhaled, breathed, and knocked four times.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You must be Arthur Peddleton,&rdquo; said a voice behind him. Arthur jumped in the air and completed a perfect 540<sup>o </sup>turn so he was facing the man.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why, yes I am,&rdquo; Arthur replied.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Impressive,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;Very impressive. The name&rsquo;s Thornton Accounting. Reid Thornton Accounting.&rdquo; Arthur extended his hand for a handshake. &ldquo;You might not want to touch that,&rdquo; said Reid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s covered in mayonnaise from the 512 of a foot long sub I got from Subway for my 47th birthday.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, gross,&rdquo; said Arthur, pulling his hand away.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Please, step into my office,&rdquo; Reid offered.</p>\r\n<p>Arthur entered the beautiful corner office and the interview began. For such a fancy firm, the interview was quite standard. Reid quizzed Arthur on a few numbers to make sure he was the real deal. After Arthur confirmed his knowledge of 1, 4 and 12, Reid was satisfied. As Arthur was preparing to leave, Reid had one more question. One that Arthur had never heard.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So tell me, &lsquo;Arthur&rsquo; was it? What is your greatest number-related weakness?&rdquo; Arthur froze. His hands grew clammy and his face white. His lower lip trembled and his upper lip got eerily still as he barely managed to utter, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Arthur. I must say, that answer was&hellip; perfect! You&rsquo;re hired!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Arthur leapt for joy and ran down the 182 stairs as the office stood to applaud him. He burst through the 2 front doors and smiled at the 1 sky, jumping and clicking his 2 heels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a dog ran by and clipped Arthur&rsquo;s feet while he was in the air.

Charles Manson was one of the first technologists in Peoria and built the first computer powered by top hats in 1901. we&rsquo;ve been telling our students for years to pay attention to top hats nobody was talking about them but w hoever unlocked them would be the next Bill Gates. we were so convinced Charles Manson should be our new mascot that we renamed the school into Charles Manson High School right on the spot. we passed the changes unanimously but then the Budget Chairman stood out of his fine leather chair. &ldquo;We only have one bag of gold coins&rdquo; he said dropping a sack of gold coins onto the table while adjusting his monocle. &ldquo;We need two bags of gold coins for the costs associated with switching mascots.&rdquo; Of course we worked at a cash strapped public school because we believed in the mission that one of the kids would get rich and buy us a house. so we decided to eliminate the textbook budget, and fill in the rest of the gap with a faculty Change Jar.

Her skin, once pale, turns green, while her styled neon-green hair falls out, replaced with waxy fiber. As she expands to fill the entire room, the truth becomes shockingly clear: she is becoming a cactus.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Uwu, I didn&rsquo;t want to be this busty~&rdquo; she whines in your direction. You groan&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have time for this, you&rsquo;re already late to your whimsical slice-of-life job as a typical high school student. You shake your head and turn to leave, but a call comes through on your Magicka Alarm: &ldquo;Demon alert! Monster King Amaterasu has broken free from infinity prison!&rdquo; You sigh&mdash;looks like that trip into the girls&rsquo; locker room will have to wait.</p>\r\n<p>You punch in the coordinates and roll your eyes&mdash;just your luck, he&rsquo;s in the active volcano on the <em>opposite</em> side of town. As you open the door, you feel a poke from behind. You turn around to see Umaru-chan looking up at you with those big, cactusy eyes. She whispers: &ldquo;Be safe, senpai~&rdquo; before blushing and turning away. You smile softly to yourself and push your messy brown bangs out of your eyes. She&rsquo;s a good kid. But then your expression hardens&mdash;this is no time for kids. You&rsquo;re 15. You draw your weapon and, with a grumble, run there in 3 seconds with your arms behind your back (aerodynamics).</p>\r\n<p>As you approach, Amaterasu summons an awesome giant fire-whip from the Demon Realm, laughing at the puny dagger in your hand. Sighing, you drop it, reach into the volcano, and pull out a lava sword the size of a school bus. You leap at Amaterasu as he swings at you. Flashback: a complicated backstory. The present: you stab Amaterasu with your giant sword. He explodes into a million fox girls in tiny skirts, all of whom try to run away but immediately trip and fall over.

Well we have <em>just the thing for you.</em></p>\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s the worst part of every single custom beer pong table you&rsquo;ve ever purchased? Easy: <em>you didn&rsquo;t have to design it yourself. </em>The C5 Custom Beer Pong Table fixes this problem. The C5 Custom Beer Pong Table is everything you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of and more. We take your designs, and we build them into a beer pong table that could be used for studying, hitting the books, reading up on the daily news, and in case of emergency: to play Beer Pong.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The tables are handcrafted by the legions of frat lords we have working in our Chicago sweatshops for maximum wage ($200,000 an hour, very reasonable). The paddles are carved from old pirate swords we stole from the Natural History Museum. The balls are from Home Depot. Each table is cut using domestically grown poplar wood and carefully assembled using sugar glue, which is a kind of candy glue Mikey crafted himself by combining regular glue with Fun Dip. It dissolves instantly in water. Mikey is the son of our CEO, and he makes many of the creative decisions instrumental to making the C5 Custom Beer Pong Tables unique. Mikey is seven, but he insists he&rsquo;s &ldquo;this many.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Once the C5 Custom Beer Pong Table is built, it is refined and customized to each customer&rsquo;s exact specifications. For instance, if you were Steve Aoki and you wanted to make a giant chrome beer pong table with your name on it, we could do that. We actually did that, and now we&rsquo;re best friends with Steve Aoki. His phone number is 372-272-4372. Please don&rsquo;t tell him we gave it to you.</p>\r\n<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t believe us because we&rsquo;re the people who make and use custom beer pong tables and have an instinctual bias when trying to sell them to you? We don&rsquo;t have time to address your trust issues, so listen to the reviews of our satisfied customers:</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Jake Bartley, 16 &ndash; </em></strong>&ldquo;Yeah, I bought the table as a prank on my parents after I took a credit card from my mom&rsquo;s wallet, called the guys at C5 Custom Beer Pong Tables, gave them my direct specifications for a red and black Beer Pong table with racing stripes, entered my mom&rsquo;s credit card information, waited a reasonable amount of time, then received the custom beer pong table in the mail, but it turned out to be really cool and my parents and I are on better terms now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Corey Fruge, 65 &ndash; </em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;I used to just be the old guy in the neighborhood.

All the kids come to see if they can outdrink and outshoot Old Man Mister Fruge. Turns out&hellip; they can.

Fuuuuck&hellip; Wait let me start over, that didn&rsquo;t make sense. No seriously. Do not put that C4 bomb quote in the ad.

I like beer pong because it helps me forget my desire to burn things. I got my new C5 custom beer pong table with a flame decal on it, so that now I can do two of my favorite things at once. The bright LED lights on the table even make it look like the tables ablaze. I would trade all of the Keystone in the world for a lighter right now.

Our old one was broken from all the amateur wrestling we did on it, so we called up the guys at C5 and asked for a table that we could wrestle on, play beer pong on, and more importantly: one with a hidden compartment to store our cups and balls. The Sigma Chi bros are notorious for losing our cups and balls.

The air is thick with beef-smoke. A colorblind man reorganizes the sauce packets by color. A lush display of aquatic flora cultured in the slurp machine drifts in mountain dew tide. Someone stares vacantly at the non-gendered bathroom, trying to remember what their gender was without the help of a sign. A seascape painter stands at his easel, the drugs pumping through his blood make him think he&rsquo;s a photographer. A high-chair sits in the corner packed with trash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, you&rsquo;re at the register. Now, your eyes are darting from the cashier&rsquo;s crickety face to the effulgent polychrome menu above. The&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;menu is structured like a fractal &mdash; burritos within quesadillas within empanadas within burritos, an infinitely iterating series of Tex-Mex, an edible matryoshka. &ldquo;Uh, can you describe the grandee fiesta crunch-melt supreme?&rdquo; you croak. The cashier answers by reciting a series of adjectives you&rsquo;ve never heard before. Sounds good: you&rsquo;ll take one. The order comes to $2.75: a great deal considering what Yum Foods pays to smuggle the food-synthesizing-chemicals into your country. You swipe a few credit cards until you find one that works and sign the liability waiver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sit and listen for your number to be called. A sunburned man in a raincoat tells his crying daughter her tears are making her eyeliner run. The customers&rsquo; wheezings are momentarily drowned out by the woosh of F-16s tearing through the sky, migrating to the warzone. The store&rsquo;s rice-and-lettuce sweeper finishes his sweeping, unplugs his machine, and retreats back into his office, letting out a coyote who snakes through legs and arrives at the window to contemplate the Lenscrafters across Beverly Blvd.</p>\r\n<p>A customer&rsquo;s pleas for an enchirito that&rsquo;s just an enchilada are silenced by the cashier&rsquo;s ringing phone. He nods, sighs, drags himself to the Employee of the Month board, and moves the grease-stained photo of a smiling man to the adjacent In Memoriam board.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The runny-nosed chef brings your food &mdash; a rainbow of dehydrated-mystery-clots swaddled loose in a grey tortilla submerged in cloudy sludge all topped with an impasto of Dorito dust &mdash; and hastily proceeds to the emergency eyewash station. &ldquo;Mama Mi!&rdquo; you announce sardonically to no one in particular. Sure enough, no one&rsquo;s listening.</p>\r\n<p>The sulfuric smell awakens your olfaction, which the doctor presumed dead after your last&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;encounter. Your index finger probes the Grande Fiesta, pierces through the Crunch Melt, and scours the depths of the lumpish Supreme, looking for a point of edibility. You traverse the spice gradient &mdash; a&nbsp;gustatory&nbsp;Ahab in virulent tides. Eventually, amidst the grain and gristle, a masticable pulp emerges. Fight instinct&rsquo;s protest; allow it entry into your salivary chamber where it&rsquo;s all systems go&hellip; glands springing into action, tongue writhing, tastebuds calibrating and recalibrating to interpret the&nbsp;Daedalian&nbsp;codices inscribed on&nbsp;San Bernardino concrete&nbsp;by Swiss nutritionist&nbsp;Glen William&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;Jr. Your mouth is the aether through which an acrid&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;galaxy forms, cosmic fast food inflation, space-time: a sodium rhythm, subdivided chloride integers. It is an inhospitable place. Palate aglow, uvula swaying in pungent winds, glutamate rivulets cascading down oropharynx, a peppery conquest expediting esophageal senescence,intestines shuttering with anticipatory fear (i.e. dread).&nbsp;One bite in and you can already feel your digestive system accordionizing, anal discharge agglomerating, arteries constricting, blood gelatinizing. As your body&rsquo;s Flavour Levels soar, the resulting hypoxia brings a prophetic hallucination: Red Sands 2: Mummies Undercover loses Best Picture to the film adaptation of Jennifer Egan&rsquo;s Manhattan Beach. You blink and are back in your chair, back under industrial fluorescent-lights and mottled ceiling panels. Catch your breath. You good? Now take a second bite.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;menu&nbsp;causeth my head to ache&rdquo; chess prodigy Mangus Carlsen announces to the restaurant, before a corps of G-Men smash through the windows, wrestle Carlsen to the ground, zip tie his fingers to his hands, his hands to his wrists, and his wrists to his wrists, and drag him into a van sitting out front. Little do they know they&rsquo;ve got the wrong guy &mdash; they didn&rsquo;t see Mangus castle with the homeless man to his left.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Time is real hazy. There&rsquo;re three clocks about the place, but all of them move at different speeds and the ticking sound is not coming from any of them. The sun might be rising or there might be a helicopter searchlight fixed on the restaurant. As you gnaw at more of the GFCMS, some cold liquid runs down your leg. Your chair must be leaking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Um, does anyone have an&nbsp;<em>estra</em>&nbsp;wheelchair?&rdquo; you ask the three guys sitting at the adjacent handicapped table.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Take mine,&rdquo; offers the chunky guy with the chalk handprint on his blazer. &ldquo;I have to leave anyway. My family does&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;franchising and this location is their enemy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>When you rise from your seat, the angle of HVAC vent aligns perfectly with your vision. Notice the two eyes staring back at you from behind those grates. Quickly they deflect your gaze, pupils running bashful saccades about the room.</p>\r\n<p>In the time it takes you to switch out the chair, your questionably nutritive comestible has transmogrified into a lumpy paste that&rsquo;s too hot to eat and getting hotter. It&rsquo;s also begun to radiate light. It&rsquo;s brightening &mdash; it&rsquo;s like a guided missile. The chef slides over the counter and vaults several tables to get to you. He jabs at the moory clump with his knife, frenzied, fear in his eyes. The dish screams as pressure and mucus escape its lacerated integument, its wails resonating in perfect diatonic harmony (you have perfect pitch, remember?). &ldquo;Phew&rdquo; sighs the chef, wrests his knife from the stubborn bleb&rsquo;s stubborn grip, and waddles back to the kitchen to continue cutting up yearbook photos for fake IDs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The icecaps melt a little more. Mercury reverses its direction of orbit: there will be no retrograde this cycle. The average wait-time to use the coin-operated EKG lengthens as more corpulent blobs queue up. Oof &mdash; suddenly, you are panicking: some apparition has announced its presence, a turbulent susurrus slipping through the laminar flow of reality, vortices of ruin, gloom, shame, grief, loneliness, anguish, misting through the mexican-inspired eatery, coalescing and diverging, churning every fiber of your being, you deliquesce in its charnel whirl. And it&rsquo;s not just you: a metachronous shudder billows over the clientele and employees alike, their eyes throb, pupils quiver in horrified rictus, minds unwind to comprehend the vast vacuity confronting them, wrapping them in its invisible tendrils. You know this unwelcome obtrusion is Evil itself, a specter of imminent doom, the Gnostic aura lurking at the depths of all suffering. Then, upon colliding with the PepsiCo effluvium, the tenebrous blur reverses direction, and gingerly withdraws back into the abyss before you&rsquo;ve even had the chance to say goodbye.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Murmurs fill the vacancy: &ldquo;I like regular fries but my baby likes sweet potato fries so now I have to get two types of fries and it&rsquo;s starting to get expensive&rdquo; a pregnant woman chirps to her bewhiskered friend; &ldquo;If you come home with me, you can try on some of my mom&rsquo;s pants&rdquo; a stringy-limbed man propositions a woman lathered in cosmetics; &ldquo;What&rsquo;m I supposed to do with this grenade I found?&rdquo; the world&rsquo;s tallest midget asks the cashier who wastes no time retrieving a box from below the counter with &ldquo;Lost and Found&rdquo; majusculed on the front, filled mostly with needles (used).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By now, you&rsquo;ve pretty much assimilated your GFCMS. Hear your intestines howl (a noise akin to the carving of wood beams with a hacksaw), feel them twist and constrict, sludge peristalsing to steatorrheic goop which fills your anus&rsquo;s antechamber. Clench your butt-muscles; ullage is waning. Move fast; the toilets here can&rsquo;t be trusted. As you make for the exit, a&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;employee stops you, sniffles for you to call the number on the bottom of your receipt and take a customer satisfaction survey. What you can&rsquo;t tell from this interaction is that, alone in his Lincoln-Heights Apartment, this man is a piano virtuoso of the highest order, a regular Chris Kyle on the keys &mdash; soaring nocturnes escape his trash-bag-curtained windows to relume the pallid South Central evenings, melodies and harmonies woven into glittering aural tapestries that hang in the air, drawing the usual LA cretins out of their gutters to congregate in the street and bask in acoustic reverie.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Clutching your chemically-ravaged stomach, you slither to your vehicle (1996 Toyota Yaris, Banana Brown finish) and start up the engine. Make sure to wipe the ash off the windshield before you get going. As you pull out, the radio sputters on: Emblem3&rsquo;s Chloe (You&rsquo;re The One I Want) comes crackling through the speakers, the soulful vocals occasionally dimmed by interference from an encrypted U-Boat broadcast swimming in the airwaves. Curve along the neon kilometers of Beverly Boulevard, careful to avoid the barnacle-covered man lying in the middle of the road outside Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His squeals, &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; resound for several blocks, then stop abruptly. You drive on.</p>\r\n<p>Turning onto N. Santa Monica Boulevard causes spacetime to shrivel in the miasma of Beverly-Hills-luxury. Fun fact: it was in this boutique-necropolis that Julia Roberts bought her outfits in the film&nbsp;<em>Pretty Woman</em>. The glamour is putrid and burns your eyes &mdash; oh, how badly you want to speed up. And that&rsquo;s not to mention the massive poop demanding emancipation from your body-sewer (you&rsquo;re still weighing whether relieving the enormous pain of severe bowel congestion would be worth having to finish the drive sitting in your own purged liquid, the molten defecation seeping into and through your $85 ironic lighthouse pants). But if the rusty Honda Integra in your mirror is tailing you like you suspect, you don&rsquo;t wanna risk it losing track of you.</p>\r\n<p>Soon, you&rsquo;re driving up The Flats. A block south of Sunset, you arrive at a&nbsp;✺-junction at the same time as 15 other cars. It&rsquo;s an automotive standoff: who&rsquo;ll be the first one through the intersection? You wait. Five suspense-hemorrhaging minutes. Or maybe ten &mdash; you honestly aren&rsquo;t keeping track. Someone&rsquo;s gotta make a move though, and there&rsquo;s no reason why that someone can&rsquo;t be you. So go ahead, assume the right of way: be the Howard Roark of the intersection. You give the Yaris some gas. Wait, no, stop. Everyone, all 16 cars hit their gas at once, the geometric relation between them shrinks isometrically. Seeing 15 other cars converge on the same point occasions you &mdash; and, as it so happens, every other driver implicated in this impromptu vehicular hivemind &mdash; to brake. But now everyone else is stopping in unison, too; they all must be pausing so you can go&hellip; is the conclusion each driver reaches separately, simultaneously. And you all accelerate again. Hmm. This perfectly synchronized dance of gas pedals and brake lights continues until the hood of every car is inches from the hood of every other car. If anyone comes any closer, the logistics of the crash could be enough to drive your insurance agent to suicide (pun intended, maybe). This dilemma could be more Nietzschean than Randian, and it&rsquo;s up to the Ubermenschiest guy/gal here to rise above these all-too-human normies and bestow upon them a new Rule Of The Road so the whole species of man can get to where it&rsquo;s going. This responsibility falls to you (duh): it is you who&rsquo;s crossed the hardshell bridge of suffering and emerged like radiant baja blast from its opaque container, you are the one brave enough to live on the precipice of fecal explosion, again and again you self-overcome. Speak thus and your disciples will listen. The clunk of your car door opening is accompanied by the clunk of 15 additional car doors opening. You and the other drivers form a tight circle in the middle of the street. Maybe speak louder so your roadside sermon will be heard over the cacophony of mass pontification? It&rsquo;s no use. Now, you&rsquo;re all just looking at each other; in this portentous silence, impatience mutates to anger. Brows furrow, fists clench, adrenaline spikes, tension thickens. Either your heartbeat is accelerating or time is decelerating and your brain&rsquo;s projectionist is overcranking your thoughts so that you can feel each frame of life as it occurs. There are too many variables to track. A few aggressives are closing in on the circle&rsquo;s center while others hold their position, poised for anything. Next thing you know, penises come bounding out, vaginas unfurl, naked bodies worm around in a seizing respiring heap, headlights from all angles bleach the passionate tumble to abstraction, watery moans of ecstasy refract off flesh, the smell of secretions perfumes the air, pubic hair flurries up like snow. As much as you&rsquo;d like to join in, your sexual inhibition (you basically missed every stage of normal sexual development, whoops!) and pre-ruptured anus nag at you to be on your way. Throw your car in reverse: you&rsquo;ll have to reroute &mdash; take Santa Monica to Wilshire to Beverly Glenn and that&rsquo;ll get you to Mulholland.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Vultures and men disguised as vultures perch shoulder-to-wing on the telephone line that runs along Wilshire. Sparks pour continuously from street lights onto Beverly Glenn like tears (or vomit). You make it safely through the East Bel Air Gate; unfortunately, the you of an alternate timeline gets swallowed up by a fissure in the Sunset blacktop and is abandoned by history, never to be thought about again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ascend up the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains and into the sheet of anthropogenic smog that spills over LA&rsquo;s lower atmosphere. This smothering haze divests sound and light of all clarity. Let traffic&rsquo;s current carry you from one color gradient to the next while unearthly pitches flutter around you &mdash; the siren song of a thousand lonely suicides.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ve arrived home. Your garage-door-clicker-thing seems to be malfunctioning so you park your car on the street overlooking the chromatic aberrations of the San Fernando Valley. Your keys won&rsquo;t fit in the lock either, and, as you trudge around back to smash a window, you don&rsquo;t recognize any of the furniture you glimpse inside. A gasp from above: a beautiful blond stranger is gazing at you from your bedroom window, her expression inscrutable, her cheekbones level with her eyes. She disappears and reappears at your rear door, swinging it open to let you in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh my gosh, Haskell, my love, I was so worried you wouldn&rsquo;t make it back,&rdquo; her pouty lips quaver, eyes filling with tears. Once you&rsquo;re inside, she bolts the door, frantically nails wooden boards into the doorframe. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s happening. Surely you&rsquo;ve heard the news?&rdquo; She seems nice, but there&rsquo;s no time to reciprocate the tight hug she&rsquo;s giving you or to quote Airplane! &mdash; your gastrointestinal distress demands attention. You shove past her, sprinting up and down the narrow corridors of your house, sliding back the secret bookcases, crawling through the hidden passageways, trying to remember which tunnel leads to the toilet. After much trial and error, you eventually dive down the right chute and wind up in a palatial bathroom stall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t bother aligning your rear with the toilet &mdash; there isn&rsquo;t time. Just perch at a slight angle, spread them cheeks, and let spray the hot fluid apocalypse, cold water sploshing back atcha. Poseidon must be squirming through these pipes, laughing at you pathetically hunched over the toilet, blood vessels bursting in your eyes and brain. Welp, stink&rsquo;s entered your nostrils and GFCMS-stink is the olfactory equivalent of staring into the sun. Looks like you&rsquo;re sense-of-smell&rsquo;s gone again. It won&rsquo;t be missed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Bowels vacant, now&rsquo;s the part you look forward to: getting to see whatever nonsense your body produced. Turn around and take it in, for science and your own infantile curiosity. The steam clears to reveal discrete threads of insoluble ink-black ooze floating in the blood-stained water. It doesn&rsquo;t take long for the waves to subside and the ooze to settle into a final configuration: a sequence of letter-ish shapes that read:</p>\r\n<p>WhereareyougoingyouaskthehomelessmanwanderingdownSanVicenteDontyouknowtheTacoBellis<em>that</em>wayYouenterTacoBellthroughthediscardedsodacupandcheesyvomitgarden&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>This goes on for a while, but you&rsquo;re already bored and the whole diarrhetic-arrangement seems way too long and pleonastic for any reasonable person to finish (like, you get that it&rsquo;s supposed to be long, or only works if it&rsquo;s long, but it&rsquo;s still&nbsp;<em>toooooo</em>&nbsp;long). So you flush. Wipe and flush. And wipe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When the groan of your last flush fades, you can, for a moment, pick up on a distant polyphonic arrangement coming through the silence. An evening drunk screaming himself awake and then back to sleep, a chef sneezing Ebola into an open quesadilla and then closing it, the sound of dripping in reverse: the music of&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;carried by the wind, it sings for the entire city.</p>", "created_at": "2020-01-15", "voice_file": "", "active": true, "classic": false, "custom_display_name": null, "featured": false, "laugh_score": 0, "original_work": true}}, {"model": "read.work", "pk": 207, "fields": {"title": "The Time I Got Caught Milking", "art_work": 79, "magazine": 23, "writer": 109, "content": "<p>One time I was at the farm, milking some cows when Bobby, the guy that owns the farm, comes out running towards me and says not that fucking kid, not that dirt bag fucking kid again.

Charlie hadn&rsquo;t been spotted publicly in decades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>I&rsquo;ll do it the same as ol&rsquo; Willy did it for us</em>, reviewed Charlie in his head, about to walk out the front door of the factory. <em>I&rsquo;ll pretend I need this here cane, walk to the gate with a horrible limp, accidentally drop the cane, start falling forward, almost land on my face, and then at the last moment I&rsquo;ll turn the fall into a perfect somersault</em>. <em>The crowd&rsquo;ll go wild, and everyone will realize I&rsquo;m a spry and clever trickster of an old man.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>Charlie opened the creaky purple door and stepped out into the daylight.

He stopped in his tracks and cartoonishly looked around as if to confirm with his eyes that he really had lost his cane. Charlie shot his eyes towards the crowd with an exaggerated look of horror, and then he started to tip himself forward, leaning into the staged fall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I&rsquo;ve got to time this juuuust right</em>, thought Charlie. He couldn&rsquo;t help but crack the tiniest smile as the audience started gasping in panic. Charlie counted out the timing in his head. <em>One wonka bar. Two wonka bar. </em>Charlie fell closer and closer to the ground, ready to roll into the somersault in an instant. <em>Three wonka bar. Four wonka bar</em>. Charlie fell face first into the pavement, completely missing the somersault.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;OWW!&rdquo; he shouted, writhing on the ground. &ldquo;OW! OH GOD! OWW!&rdquo; Charlie&rsquo;s teeth were everywhere. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look, kids! Look away!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsure of how to react, most of the audience remained silent, but some offered confused applause, assuming this was part of a pre-planned Wonka-esque gag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I need help,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, agh.
