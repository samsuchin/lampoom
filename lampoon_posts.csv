12,"Apps & integrations","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1 id=""zapier"">Zapier</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can connect your Ghost site to over 1,000 external services using the official integration with&nbsp;<a href=""https://zapier.com/"">Zapier</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p><strong>Example</strong>: When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1 id=""editing-your-theme"">Editing your theme</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the biggest advantages of using Ghost over centralised platforms is that you have total control over the front end of your site. Either customise your existing theme, or create a new theme from scratch with our&nbsp;<a href=""https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/"">Theme SDK</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can integrate&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;front end code into a Ghost theme without restriction, and it will work just fine. No restrictions!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Here are some common examples</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Include comments on a Ghost blog with&nbsp;<a href=""https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/disqus/"">Disqus</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/discourse/"">Discourse</a></li><li>Implement&nbsp;<a href=""https://help.ghost.org/article/89-mathjax"">MathJAX</a>&nbsp;with a little bit of JavaScript</li><li>Add syntax highlighting to your code snippets using&nbsp;<a href=""https://prismjs.com/"">Prism.js</a></li><li>Integrate any dynamic forms from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.google.com/forms/"">Google</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.typeform.com/"">Typeform</a>&nbsp;to capture data</li><li>Just about anything which uses JavaScript, APIs and Markup.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1 id=""using-the-public-api"">Using the Public API</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ghost itself is driven by a set of core APIs, and so you can access the Public Ghost JSON API from external webpages or applications in order to pull data and display it in other places.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>The Ghost API is&nbsp;<a href=""https://docs.ghost.org/api/"">thoroughly documented</a>&nbsp;and straightforward to work with for developers of almost any level.</p></blockquote>

76,"Far far away, behind the word mountains","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. <strong>Mountains </strong>are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, <a href=""#"">weather conditions</a>, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge <strong>mountain ranges</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":414,""sizeSlug"":""large""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/veenv2/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chris-lawton-c0rIh0nFTFU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-414""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used <strong>less for agriculture</strong> and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The highest mountain on <strong>Earth </strong>is <strong>Mount Everest</strong> in the <strong>Himalayas of Asia</strong>, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the <a href=""#"">Solar System</a> is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Definition</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the <strong>Oxford English Dictionary</strong> a mountain is defined as ""a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. Mount Scott outside Lawton, <strong>Oklahoma, USA</strong>, is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""><p>Physical Geography states ""Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.""</p><cite> Whittow's Dictionary </cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Geology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are <strong>three main types of mountains</strong>: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"">volcanic</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_mountain"">fold</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault-block_mountain"">block</a>. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust <strong>move</strong>, <strong>crumple</strong>, and <strong>dive</strong>. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock"">igneous matter</a> forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in <strong>long linear arcs</strong>, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Volcanoes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Volcanoes </strong>are formed when a plate is <strong>pushed below another plate</strong>, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano. <strong>Examples of volcanoes</strong> include <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji"">Mount Fuji</a> in Japan and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pinatubo"">Mount Pinatubo</a> in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_Mountain"">Navajo Mountain</a> in the US. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Fold mountains</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fold mountains</strong> occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened. Since the less dense continental crust ""floats"" on the denser <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)"">mantle</a> rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas. Rock can fold either <strong>symmetrically </strong>or <strong>asymmetrically</strong>. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Mountains"">Balkan Mountains</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jura_Mountains"">Jura Mountains</a> are examples of fold mountains. </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Block mountains</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>B<strong>lock mountains</strong> are caused by faults in the crust: a plane where rocks have moved past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain. The uplifted blocks are <strong>block mountains</strong> or <strong>horsts</strong>. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range Province of <strong>Western North America</strong> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine_graben"">Rhine</a> valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned. </p>

98,"These Are The 10 Best Restaurants in The World","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each year, fine diners, restaurateurs and food writers—I’m in the last group—try to read the annual <strong>World’s 50 Best Restaurant</strong> list like tea leaves, searching for trends, or at the very least, a coherent theme. But as in previous years, the <a href=""#"">2014 edition</a>, which was announced in London late last month, defies unifying logic. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The restaurants that made the full list of 100 range from <strong>David Chang’s</strong> decidedly informal and unsedate <strong>Momofuku Ssam Bar</strong>, to Alain Ducasse’s paragon of plushness, Louis XIV, in Monaco.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After losing the top ranking in 2013 (it had held the No. spot for the three previous years), <strong>Noma </strong>is firing on all cylinders these days. Located in an old whaling warehouse, the restaurant is the birthplace of <strong>“new Nordic”</strong> cuisine, which relies solely on ingredients available in region. But today, the restaurant is pushing far beyond its early days of foraged sea buckthorn and reindeer lichen. </p>

<p>Dinner these days might start with a whole kohlrabi, filled with its fermented juice and bored with a straw, so that it looks and tastes like a coconut drink.

<p><strong>Music</strong> is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch <strong>(which governs melody and harmony)</strong>, rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the <a href=""#"">sonic qualities</a> of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the <strong>""color""</strong> of a musical sound). </p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different <strong>styles</strong> or <strong>types</strong> of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. <strong>Music </strong>is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without <a href=""#"">instrumental accompaniment</a>) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from <strong>Greek μουσική</strong> (mousike; <strong>""art of the Muses""</strong>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Ancient Greek</strong> and <strong>Indian philosophers</strong> defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as ""<em><a href=""#"">the harmony of the spheres</a></em>"" and ""it is music to my ears"" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as ""not being music"", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge string quartet in <strong>1825</strong>, early jazz in the beginning of the <strong>1900s</strong> and hardcore punk in the <strong>1980s</strong>. </p>

144,"The meaning of health has evolved over time","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In keeping with the biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example of such a definition of health is: ""a state characterized by anatomic, physiologic, and <a href=""#"">psychological integrity</a>; ability to perform personally valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical, biological, psychological, and social stress"".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then in 1948, in a radical departure from previous definitions, the World <strong>Health Organization (WHO)</strong> proposed a definition that aimed higher: linking health to well-being, in terms of ""physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity"". </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""left"",""id"":425,""sizeSlug"":""medium""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""alignleft size-medium""><img src=""http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/veenv2/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/matthew-hamilton-BeeMMFF_jso-unsplash-200x300.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-425""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized as being vague, <a href=""#"">excessively broad</a> and was not construed as measurable. For a long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the <strong>practicality </strong>of the biomedical model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the <strong>health promotion movement in the 1980s</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as ""a resource for living"". 1984 WHO revised the definition of health defined it as ""the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a <strong>resource for everyday</strong> life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities"".</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> An important way to maintain your personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrients"">nutrients</a>&nbsp;to your body. Such nutrients give you energy and keep your body running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e.&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure"">blood pressure</a>). </p>

Making healthy food choices is important because it can lower your risk of heart disease, developing some types of&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"">cancer</a>, and it will contribute to maintaining a healthy weight.</p>

<h3>Sleep</h3>

<p> Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"">sleep deprivation</a>&nbsp;has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.&nbsp;In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.&nbsp;Due to the role of sleep in regulating&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_and_metabolism"">metabolism</a>, insufficient sleep may also play a role in&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain"">weight gain</a>&nbsp;or, conversely, in impeding&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss"">weight loss</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t seem quite credible. And yet it wasn’t the kind of shock that followed the news of J.F.K. being cut down. There had been so much speculation about Presley’s mental and physical health that his death was unpleasantly predictable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was almost impossible to know what to think. My first impulse was to pick up the phone and call a couple of people. I tried two numbers, but they were both busy. Obviously other people had reacted the same way. It was the kind of news that demanded to be passed on. Elvis had always been there. For more than two decades he’d maintained a unique position in too many people’s lives. Despite all the depressing rumours it scarcely seemed possible that he’d gone, that <strong>Elvis Presley</strong> was dead at 42.</p>

There was no voice telling me that I’d never see <a href=""#"">Elvis Presley</a> again. Jesus Christ, I’d never seen him, ever. I didn’t even regret that I’d never get the chance to see him. The <strong>Elvis Presley</strong> I’d have given my right arm to watch was the wild hoodlum in the gold jacket who vanished into the US Army and never returned. I’d mourned his passing many years ago.</p>

I don’t care if he’s trying to leverage a frickin’ gold mine, I–Hey watch it, kid!<em> </em>No yeah, I’m just getting a quick hose down and this kid has no idea what he’s doing. (<em>Chuckling</em>) Yeah. Oh yeah. Big time dipshit. Definitely his first time.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Sorry. (<em>continues washing</em>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– There’s plenty of boys on this city’s corners who’d kill for a wash job like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Ok.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Alright. Alright. I’ll be at the office soon. Just a few miles walk away. Buh bye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Ok, I think I’m done. That’s $20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– $20? I didn’t ask for a premium splash job. It was just a standard wash. You didn’t even get these shit marks out of my underwear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– I’m sorry I just, I only have one price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– All you guys are the same. Try to nickel and dime me at the last second. These pants are soiled. You got my shit all wet. Now it’s gonna drip everywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Oh man. I just...why did you shit in your pants?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Look. You seem like a good kid so I’m gonna let you off easy. This is two dollars. And I want you to have it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– But it’s $20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Look at me. I’m about to walk three miles to work<strong> </strong>soaking wet. By the time I get there it’s gonna evaporate and I’m gonna need a whole ‘nother hosedown. This was useless. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a meeting to attend (s<em>tarts to leave)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Wait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– <em>(Stops and comes back)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– I want you to have this<em> (gives him the two dollars)</em>. I gave you a dogshit scrub down and then I tried to scam you for $20. You deserve better.&nbsp; I mean Christ, I didn’t even get the shit out your ass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– You know, not a lot of kids would have the nerve to say that. Hey. Have you ever seen an office before?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Yes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– Come on, I think you’ll like this <em>(walk off together, arm in arm).</em></p>

<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>The Orange Gourd:</strong> This one will kill you 100%.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>The Ghost Pepper:</strong> This one is less pungent, still quite deadly. Will kill you 100%.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>The Reddest of the Red:</strong> Another 100% kill.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Dark Gourd:</strong> This gourd will actually transport you to another realm, the half-day holidays realm. For this realm all holidays are for half the people there and the other half are too busy. Keep in mind this is a 100% kill.</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>People Gourd:</strong> Half-Man, Half-Gourd. The People gourd is a friendly guy. He’ll shine your shoes and hug your wife in a way that doesn’t make you uncomfortable or feel like less of a man. Very poisonous though. One bite is sure to kill you (100% chance).</span></li>
<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Decorative Gourd from the local market:</strong> Unfortunately covered in lead. The bomb inside will kill you 100%.</span></li>

If you try and eat the Pumpkin Gourd in its natural form (whole pumpkin, no bites) you will be killed, unfortunately, and that is a 100% chance.</span></li>

925,"Staring Contest","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today is the big day I prove to everyone down by the pond that I’m tough enough to be here, and you know what that means: challenging the toughest guy at the pond to a staring contest. The toughest guy at the pond is the Sun.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Competition is about intimidation. I walk out having drank 63 oz of pond water and I’m pissing wildly in every direction, but with nearly no force. I can only maintain the pee for thirty minutes, so I rip off my shades and stare directly into the Sun. It bursts into flames. Nice, a point for me. I burst into flames. We’ll count that as a point for me as well. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Halfway through the contest I realize I’m getting a phone call. Halfway through the phone call I realize it’s the sound of the flames, and that I should cool down if I’m to continue staring into the Sun. I try distraction and blow a kiss towards the Sun. He doesn’t blink, but the pond people go wild. For those keeping score, it’s seventeen-to-one in my favor. Match point. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All the pond people gather around and take sides. Pond Henry and Pond Leah start filling their goodie bags with tiger lillies. They’re backing me. All of the Pond Vietnamese monks begin lighting themselves on fire. They’re backing me as well. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After a light eternity, I blink. The Sun blinks. We both go blind. We call it a draw, but the pond people seem to think otherwise. The point system works in reverse so it looks like I’ve ended up with twenty-five bonus points while the Sun has burst into flames.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I hear the pond people chanting my name in celebration. It’s uplifting, but would be more so if my name weren’t “Fuck The Sun, Fuck That Damn Sun, Fuck Everyone Who Ever Doubted You, Fuck the Whole System In Fact! Even More So, Fuck God! Fuck All of the Gods! Specifically, Fuck The Sun God! I’m not scared to say it: Fuck God! There! I said it!”</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is a very common name by the pond, so they may have been chanting to someone else.</span></p>

1059,"Snails Need Love Too","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A darkly handsome bladesman stood at the edge of the clearing. I didn’t recognize him, but his physique was immediately jarring - I felt a sudden strong impulse of being so deeply infatuated that nothing else mattered any longer. My life’s work, my quest, fell away in an instant, like so many wisps of smoke on a windy day. I walked forward, advancing across the meadow toward the distant treeline. He cast one furtive glance in my direction and turned away, disinterested. Not one to be easily dissuaded, I started running through the long grass and small flowers. I couldn’t bear letting him out of my sight. After what seemed a lifetime he was nearly within my grasp. I bade him turn around, my face red and hair dishevelled. In his infinite generosity he obeyed. I felt his powerful, stormy eyes take in my body. I had never before felt anything so strongly, so deeply. “Who… what are you?” I managed, panting, staring up into his awesome figure. And after what seemed a lifetime he answered.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“I am a God and I am the Shadow. I am everything and nobody - I am a lie you tell yourself at night. I am Death incarnate; I am the cold wind through the sycamore trees. Few see me but all desire. I have never told a lie and never felt pain. I have never harmed without reason, yet no one escapes my sight unscathed.” He slowly walked towards me. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Come ever closer. “My sword is Pain; it cuts the air in half. My touch is the ice of deepest winter, my - shoot I just stepped on a snail. Oh no. This is actually messed up for real. Oh geez. I totally crushed it. My foot is ruined.”</span></p>

1061,"My First Kiss","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I pick up this girl Julia in my car, and I’m doing 90 on Lincoln Avenue, you know, batting mailboxes. I’m just shaking cause I’m so nervous about our date, and she’s just screaming her head off, probably because she’s so excited but also maybe a little nervous too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But I don’t have my driver’s license anymore — I was responsible for a massive car crash that killed 7 people and their children, and I forgot my license at the hospital afterwards. So anyway, I crash the car with Julia in it as sort of an artistic homage to that crash. “Phew, that was a close one,” I think when I see both my legs close to being completely separated from my body.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now Julia’s screaming that we need to go to the hospital, because that’s where our date was planned; I wanted to pick up my license, and more importantly, Julia loves the food they serve at the hospital food court.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I call a cab, which takes us to the nearest train station, and then from there we walk to the hospital. We sit down at Burger King, and some guy catcalls Julia. That guy finds my fist coming straight at his face, motioning in sign language how that was pretty messed up. Then I kick him in the shin. Turns out he isn’t deaf, but instead has a black belt in taekwondo, which he pulls out and shows me before the three of us enjoy a peaceful meal together.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the walk home, I look deep into Julia’s eyes, and I see her pupils dilating from her concussion. I get my smoochers ready, and Julia starts to lean in, but then she whispers, “I’m gay.” Bummer. “As in, like, I’m really happy right now.” Phew! “As in, like, I’m really happy being single. But you know what — let’s just go for it.”</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Her lips? Moist. Her tongue? It was there, too. Her face? Round in all the right places. Would I kiss her again? Listen pal, I haven’t even stopped.</span></p>

1073,"Yo Mama So Fat","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-...is the best way I thought I could begin breaking this news, Timmy. I’m so sorry. She’s dead.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-Oh my God… what happened, Doc?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-She came in complaining of something, but the ER receptionist didn’t understand since he doesn’t speak whale. We tried doing some preliminary x-rays on her but we couldn’t because they don’t make satellites that big. We managed to do an MRI, but when we hung the images up they fell off the wall and through the floor. She had a terrible fever but we couldn’t get her into a cold bath since SeaWorld was closed. She then fell into a coma, and broke it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-Jesus, Doc, I can’t believe how much she suffer-</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-Her left hand started developing some very troubling hives, so I told the nurse to walk around and check the right hand, and she’s still walking. She eventually snapped out of the coma but didn’t regain full control of her body for some time since she she has to wake up in sections. We found a swimming pool to bathe her in and added just a drop of water, but she overflowed it and took out the cancer wing. This freaked her out and she escaped towards the city, where the police and military fired at her -- though it was ineffective since they don’t shoot in panoramic. I chased her in my car and she charged at me, but when I tried to swerve around her I ran out of gas. I leapt out of my car and climbed up to her head to try and tell her to stop but when I got to the top my ears popped so hard I forgot where I was. What finally did her in was when she tripped on a dent in the ground that her shadow made and she fell and bonked her head on a plant. We thought it appropriate to give her a last meal, but when we asked what her favorite food was she said “seconds”. She then gasped her last breath and accelerated global warming by 175 years. I’m sorry you’re finding out about this so late -- we had trouble finding her address to notify next of kin, since both her asscheeks are in different zip codes.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-Doc… that’s horrible, Doc. But you did all you could. At least she’s in heaven now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-Timmy, not even God’s arms are strong enough to lift that ass. Your mother is most certainly in Hell.</span></p>

1080,Tuxedo,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glad I’ve got someone interested in buying Tuxedo. My father died in this tuxedo, and then it was regifted to me one Christmas as a kid. She’s been a second skin to me, and she’ll be with you for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In this tux, I’ve fought two wars and been discharged as many times. These stains here? German blood, with a little Irish from my mom’s side. Turns out I bleed a lot, and the fabric isn’t great for stopping bullets. But it is good for starting conversations. Private, why are you wearing a tuxedo? Right back at ya, sarge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t worry, the bow tie is included with the tux. Wearing a tux without a bow tie would be like showering without a tux.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wore this tux when I got married and wore it when I got divorced. She wanted to get her hands on this tux, but a lot of people want a lot of things. Enjoy the tux-less house and kids, Kathleen.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sure, I’d love to not sell this tux. But I trust all the doctors telling me this is the right thing to do for my emotional and physical state. I just want to make sure she’s on good shoulders. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with any well-worn item of clothing, she’ll keep you surprised — I’m always finding new pockets, new holes for my head, and new sleeves. Every day I look at Tuxedo and think: who rescued who?</span></p>

1095,"A Day in the Life of Hamish Olsen, New York, 1946","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">She looked at him like a deer in headlights might look at someone if it had human eyes. Hamish had interviewed a million girls like her for a job, a billion probably, maybe fewer, but still every time he was surprised that they managed to get into his office. He wasn’t hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The girl wiped the security guard’s blood on her skirt and hiked it up a bit to show Hamish a glimpse of her knees and penis. Sigh, Hamish said aloud instead of sighing.  He knew the drill. Girl from Bumfucksville, Manhattan with a winning smile and a folder full of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Naruto</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> fanart wants to be a star. Greases a few palms, offers to clean up the grease for a price, and before you know it she’s fucked her way so high up the Empire State you’re bringing </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">her </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the Alka Seltzer. Entitled. Thinks just ‘cause she got her period before the other girls at school that every door’s gonna open for her even though automatic doors haven’t been invented yet and she’s got a thumb that looks like a toe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“So, you want to be in pictures,” Hamish muttered under his breath to practice what he was going to say. “Excuse me?” She’d heard him, and now he was embarrassed. Hamish looked out the window and spat at his reflection. The window was open, and the window cleaner looked really offended.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He spun his chair around so he was facing the girl and spun around a second time for fun. “The pictures, toots. The silver screen.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Oh, duh. Movies, yeah. Just call them movies.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He took a bite of his cigarette. Truth is this girl wasn’t half bad. Hair like shiny rope, nostrils you could fit a fist into, extra long tits, and an enormous, freakish mouth. Like her mouth was for real so big. He sat there looking at her for ten, fifteen minutes, and decided that he’d give her the job after all. “OK, this is a paper mill. We make paper. Not movies. Sorry.” He tipped her a tootsie roll wrapper for her time, and just like that, she was gone.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Fuck.” Another day, another dollar in the swear jar.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hamish stared out the window, and thought about really sad things, like global warming and the fact that the girl had left. She was a rare dame: a desert flower, and flowers don’t just grow on trees. And now she was dead, probably. “Hi, excuse me,” she said, alively. “Can you unlock the door?” Hamish got up from his chair, and pushed her out the window. She was dead for real this time, and he could be sad again. “Hey, sorry.” Her again, first floor office. “Do you validate parking?” He threw his paperweight at her. Sad.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hamish drove back home for what felt like years. Everything was bad. He didn’t love his wife half as much as he loved money, and, oh man, money got him real hard. Dumb broad didn’t even know he was sleeping with her dad, and they’d been doing it in the bunk above her for years since he’d died. Everything stank. Hamish’s breath smelled like piss even though he’d barely had any, and his car </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">reeked </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">of the dead rat that was trapped in the hose he used to pipe exhaust into the cabin. He’d been going in circles on the same roundabout for two hours.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Suddenly, a deer came on the road. It looked at Hamish like a callback to the girl from the beginning of the piece. Hamish stared, and the deer stared back, an infinity in its eyes, an all-loving expanse, and for a second, everything was in harmony. And then the deer smashed through the windshield and impaled Hamish through the chest with its antlers and basically shredded his innards and got blood all over his brand new car and it was really gross.</span></p>

1098,"Dear President","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dear President,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My name is Bradley and I am 8. I’m from Ohio and my mom won’t let me play on the computer. Will you come and tell her to let me play on the computer? I want to really b</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">adly. There is a game where you jump that is looking very fun to me.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also I want to sleep over at my friend Corey’s house but my mom said no and you have to tell her to say yes. Corey’s mom does bad things but she buys Lunchables that I want to eat. And Corey has an Xbox! His mom does really bad things.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m going to visit my grandpa next weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Love,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bradley</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">P.S. I am going to be a Navy SEAL with a gun. Love Bradley.</span></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dear Bradley,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m glad you wrote me such a wonderful letter. It’s clear that you are a thoughtful and bright young man.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I suppose you are young, and this may seem odd, but normally, the President of the United States does not get involved in matters like this. But this is no normal circumstance. Bradley as soon as you receive this letter I need you to pick up the phone and call 911. Tell them to send an ambulance to your home address. Now I hope no one gets hurt, but I cannot fully guarantee your mother’s safety.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m familiar with the game Jumping Jeremy. It is a very fun game. I have also slept over at Corey’s house and it is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">very </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fun. You are correct about him having an Xbox. Within 24 hours I will be at your home. Your mother and I will have a discussion, and like I said there is a solid chance she will be gravely injured.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bradley, I’m going to kill your mother. You need to go down into the basement and wait until it’s over. It may seem overboard to bring SEAL Team 6, which is why I’m not bringing them. Just me and my bodyguards.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Being the president is a complicated and, frankly, stressful job. But it’s letters from children like you that give me hope and remind me why I chose to sit in the Oval Office in the first place. I hope you have a wonderful time at your grandfather’s house!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The President</span></p>

They’ve been with each other through the entirety of the Cody, Wyoming public school system, but Nate has never given Justin more than a hello. Justin has gone to extreme lengths in his courtship of Nate: he nearly lost his finger saving Nate during the 2014 Cody High School homecoming fiasco; he once repainted his home to mirror Nate’s, so that they could hopefully and coincidentally notice it on the walk back from school and share a laugh; he’s spent thousands of his parents’ dollars on concert tickets, clowns, assorted novelties, and once even a small dog. All these favors Nate has accepted without thanks.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Nate isn’t a bad person. He isn’t out to dislike anyone or to intentionally be mean. He bathes regularly and warmly. For whatever reason he was simply never interested in befriending Justin, nor did he notice that Justin wanted to befriend him. Nate just wanted to lead his simple life. If he had his way, he would live and die in Cody. Maybe he’d work at the post office with his dad. Or at the hospital with his mom. His dog would be dying soon -- surely he would adopt and care for at least one more. He would probably marry someone he went to high school with. And he already had friends. He didn’t need another one.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Enter Bradley. Bradley always had a deep hatred for Nate. He was never sure why he held this hatred -- the only thing he was sure of was that he wanted to make Nate hurt. From the age of four, Bradley had been conceiving of the perfect prank -- one that would forever ruin Nate’s image in this town that he would never leave. After 14 years of intense planning, Bradley’s prank was finally complete. It begins with Nate stepping on a bear trap whose teeth have been replaced with sponges covered in bear pheromones (this will be important later). After Nate’s leg is caught, a spring activates from beneath the bear trap, catapulting Nate out of his clothes and into a helicopter waiting overhead. The interior of the helicopter is covered in banana peels, causing Nate to slip around and look like an idiot. If the sight of Nate repeatedly slipping and flailing his arms isn’t funny enough, then the pilot and co-pilot and full studio audience in the helicopter are dosed with laughing gas so they can get really high and have a great time regardless. After a safe landing, Nate slips one more time then regains his footing and exits the helicopter. A team of NASCAR pit mechanics sprints out from cover and slathers Nate in cashew butter -- at which point a swarm of dogs are dispatched to his location, all of them geriatric and fully missing their teeth. The dogs use their soft wet gums to eat the cashew butter off of Nate, revealing a poorly-spelled Chinese tattoo the NASCAR guys put on him which says “kickflip pizzazz bastard”. This is the point of no return -- if Nate hasn’t been humiliated enough to continue, then Bradley, observing all of this from a nearby bush, will activate a shotgun aimed at his own chest and end it all, his life’s work having been worthless. If the prank continues, then Nate is shoved into a van. He has a paper bag put over his head, his crotch forced to an open window so his flaccid penis flaps wildly in the wind. The paper bag has a silly face on it. Nate is brought to the high school football field, where he is placed face-up on a mattress. The Viagra that was infused into the cashew butter and absorbed through Nate’s skin is finally taking effect, and he has the hardest erection of his young life. The whole town is watching from the bleachers as the mattress contracts and retracts in such a way that it forces Nate’s head into his crotch and back, making him suck his own penis for 3 hours. The elderly dogs, quite erect from the same cashew butter, rush the field in the middle of this and hump holes into the mattress, causing it to short-circuit and contract even faster. Afterwards everyone laughs because the bear pheromones from the bear trap were just bear pee, and now Nate smells.</em></p>

John Lowe tries to hide behind his piano, but Paul lunges from across the room and rips through the piano’s body, emerging from the cloud of splinters with Lowe’s neck in his hand.

1153,"The History of Hats","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are all types of hats, like silver or classic. But hats haven’t always dominated our collective psyche. See, there was this guy Randolph R. Hats, and he had the last name Hats, which was super cool. But it was actually his second cousin, Greg <em>Miller</em>, who went to jail for selling high-grade cocaine to young children. Anyway, Randolph R. Hats invented hats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See, Randolph was sunbathing by the pool, the skin on his face all burnt and crusty, and suddenly, a thought crossed his mind — do some dogs need glasses? After he determined there was no conceivable way dogs needed glasses, he realized humans have been exposed to sunlight for several years. So he invented sunscreen, which failed spectacularly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Randolph had to think of something less creamy. Baseball caps were around, but they were exclusively for people who played indoor volleyball. So Randolph went to the patent office with the idea for an inclusive hat, but he forgot it was a Sunday. On Sundays, the patent officers deny patents to the Portuguese. Randolph tried again, but they <em>still</em> denied his patent, even though he waited seven days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Randolph invented hats a few years later to protect himself against bear attacks. Well, that didn’t really work since when he went hiking in the woods, he forgot to wear his hat. A few broken fibulas couldn’t stop Randolph from inventing, though. Ever heard of bicycle helmets? Well, Randolph was wearing one when he invented the lightbulb.</p>

1156,Family,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve got a crazy family — two brothers, four sisters, three half-brothers, one quarter-sister, one mom, three dads, and one very racist grandchild — and I love ‘em all to death.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The day I was born, my mother gave birth to approximately 10 other kids. My mom was pushing and pushing, then she finally got the door open and lay down on the delivery room bed. Next, my brother Ronnie came out of that vagina and was immediately arrested for public nudity. Ronnie is the real deal — big shoulders, wide hips, the whole shebang. Nowadays, Ronnie serves drinks at the Rascal Lounge, which really pisses off the bartender there.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next oldest brother is Grant. There was this one classic story, where Ronnie threw Grant into a lake, and Grant was drowning pretty bad. Ronnie started to feel guilty and thought maybe he should save Grant. But he ultimately decided to keep drowning him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, the next two out of the womb were stillbirths. The one after that was my brother Jeremy, who was a stillbirth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then came Dave — don’t even get me <em>started</em> on Dave. Dave the Knave! Dave-zilla! David! He’s a bullfighter and part-time PETA Vice President. I only found out Dave was a bullfighter at the biannual Tokyo Rodeo a few years back. “You know, I’m a pretty gifted bullfighter” Dave said to me in the crowd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can’t freaking wait for you to hear about Louis, though. <em>Louis!</em> LOUIS. Louis. Where do I even begin? Louis grew up to be a human trafficker. But this was a time when many other people were human traffickers, so Louis was arrested along with many other people.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then along came Leslie, another stillbirth. Leslie actually just landed a big role in the movie “Alien vs. Stillbirth” as the alien.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then finally, me. I was born with this birthmark covering my entire face. I’ve since been plagued by a lifetime of being self-conscious, even though the birthmark was removed right away.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But of all 9 kids, I was the only one my mother kept. Why? I’m pretty good at hula hooping. I’m not great — occasionally I mess up and my arms get caught in the hoop and I can’t really get them out or else I’d risk knocking the hoop down which is just embarrassing, so I just have to stand there with my arms trapped for a couple hours. But I’m pretty good.</p>

<p>Hello, is this the mother of Steve Austin? The stone cold professional wrestler? The 54 year old man? Yes, I’m just calling to say that Steve–there is nothing more I can teach him. With the gift that he has–he does not belong in Kindergarten. Or any room with children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was math when I thought Steve had “the gift”. I asked the kids, “What is four times five?” We didn’t even cover multiplication yet, but Steve knocked 20 kids out. No hesitation. Then he also knocked out 34 children in alphabetical order.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that, we bumped him to fourth grade. We thought, “there’s no way he’ll knock out fourth graders and excel in school”. We were right. He did marvelous, and didn’t hurt a single fourth grader. We are still unsure how he got his hands on those kindergarteners.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually with so many students at risk, we try and intervene, but we were scared shitless, so we sent in 6th grade peer mediators. Big mistake. They were even bigger pussies than us. They gave up their peers and Steve ended up with 17 fresh pre-schoolers. He waited a year, and then delivered a graduation brainblaster to every one of those 17 kindergarteners. After this, we had to re-evaluate: 4th grade might not be challenging enough for Steve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steve is a darling to have in class, but he is a danger to others. The problem decreased for a bit when we moved the kindergarteners to another building, but it increased a lot more after Steve figured out how to walk to that building. At this point, the only real option is that we wrap the kids in padding because even if we pull Steve out of school he still knows where the kindergarten building is.</p>

He complains to the flight attendant that his time is expensive, but they’re letting out the first class passengers first, and there’s nothing I can do about it, sir. Pitbull flashes a smile at an 8-year-old the next row over and rolls his eyes as if to say “can you believe they’re making <em>me</em> wait?”, but the kid’s glued to his iPad and doesn’t even bat an eye.</p>

1166,"The Number 6","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Arthur Peddleton is unable to comprehend the number 6.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It began as a normal day for Arthur Peddleton. He rose from his bed and sighed contentedly as he stretched his full 5’9” frame towards the ceiling. He dressed in the same outfit he always did when he went in for a job interview: a plain white button-down shirt with 5 buttons and a pair of khaki pants with 2 leg holes. He brushed his teeth for exactly 44 seconds and fell down the stairs exactly twice. Nothing, not even a set of jagged stone stairs covered in glass and poison, could bring him down today; he had a chance at his dream job: an accountant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arthur arrived at the offices of Reid Thornton Accounting at 99 Boylston Street 10 minutes early. If his professional tennis player of a mother had taught him anything it was to arrive early and how to play tennis. He took the elevator to the 19th floor of the tall glass building, and a friendly attendant informed him that Reid’s office was the third one on the left. Arthur approached the door, inhaled, exhaled, breathed, and knocked four times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You must be Arthur Peddleton,” said a voice behind him. Arthur jumped in the air and completed a perfect 540<sup>o </sup>turn so he was facing the man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Why, yes I am,” Arthur replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Impressive,” the man replied. “Very impressive. The name’s Thornton Accounting. Reid Thornton Accounting.” Arthur extended his hand for a handshake. “You might not want to touch that,” said Reid. “It’s covered in mayonnaise from the 512 of a foot long sub I got from Subway for my 47th birthday.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh yeah, gross,” said Arthur, pulling his hand away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Please, step into my office,” Reid offered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arthur entered the beautiful corner office and the interview began. For such a fancy firm, the interview was quite standard. Reid quizzed Arthur on a few numbers to make sure he was the real deal. After Arthur confirmed his knowledge of 1, 4 and 12, Reid was satisfied. As Arthur was preparing to leave, Reid had one more question. One that Arthur had never heard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “So tell me, ‘Arthur’ was it? What is your greatest number-related weakness?” Arthur froze. His hands grew clammy and his face white. His lower lip trembled and his upper lip got eerily still as he barely managed to utter, “I don’t have one.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, Arthur. I must say, that answer was… perfect! You’re hired!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arthur leapt for joy and ran down the 182 stairs as the office stood to applaud him. He burst through the 2 front doors and smiled at the 1 sky, jumping and clicking his 2 heels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a dog ran by and clipped Arthur’s feet while he was in the air. He did a half flip and landed really hard on his shoulder. He was slow to get up, but he was fine.</p>

<p>Tom is strolling along the railroad tracks, whistling a happy tune. Jerry walks parallel to Tom on the other side of the tracks, whistling in equally jolly fashion. Suddenly, Tom notices Jerry’s presence. This is his shot. With a sly smile he inches casually across the tracks towards Jerry, unaware of the not-so-distant whistle of a train. As he nears Jerry, Tom licks his lips and reaches out. Then, Jerry unsheathes his hitherto concealed samurai sword and plunges it into Tom’s heart. Their eyes meet, Tom’s filled with desperation and Jerry’s empty. For a moment all is silent. Jerry twists the sword and Tom releases his final breath, collapsing to the ground. Jerry drops the sword and continues on his way. He has a lot of distance to cover before nightfall. As Jerry’s silhouette moves below the horizon, an anvil falls from the sky onto Tom’s corpse.</p>

1180,"Charlie and the Next Successor","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was time for old Charlie to pick the next child to take over the chocolate factory just as Willy Wonka had done with him. <em>Here we go</em>, he thought, putting on his orange pants, his purple jacket, and his 3 foot tall top hat. Charlie hadn’t been spotted publicly in decades.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>I’ll do it the same as ol’ Willy did it for us</em>, reviewed Charlie in his head, about to walk out the front door of the factory. <em>I’ll pretend I need this here cane, walk to the gate with a horrible limp, accidentally drop the cane, start falling forward, almost land on my face, and then at the last moment I’ll turn the fall into a perfect somersault</em>. <em>The crowd’ll go wild, and everyone will realize I’m a spry and clever trickster of an old man.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charlie opened the creaky purple door and stepped out into the daylight. As he began to walk with his fake limp, his fake hunch, and his fake cane, the large crowd of chattering onlookers quickly fell silent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Heheh,</em> thought Charlie, walking at a painfully slow speed towards the gate. <em>They really think I’m a decrepit rickety old man.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two minutes of slowly limping forward, Charlie reached the spot where he would “accidentally” drop his cane.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie let go of the walking stick and took two quick steps forward without it. He stopped in his tracks and cartoonishly looked around as if to confirm with his eyes that he really had lost his cane. Charlie shot his eyes towards the crowd with an exaggerated look of horror, and then he started to tip himself forward, leaning into the staged fall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I’ve got to time this juuuust right</em>, thought Charlie. He couldn’t help but crack the tiniest smile as the audience started gasping in panic. Charlie counted out the timing in his head. <em>One wonka bar. Two wonka bar. </em>Charlie fell closer and closer to the ground, ready to roll into the somersault in an instant. <em>Three wonka bar. Four wonka bar</em>. Charlie fell face first into the pavement, completely missing the somersault.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “OWW!” he shouted, writhing on the ground. “OW! OH GOD! OWW!” Charlie’s teeth were everywhere. “Don’t look, kids! Look away!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsure of how to react, most of the audience remained silent, but some offered confused applause, assuming this was part of a pre-planned Wonka-esque gag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I need help,” said Charlie. “I can’t, agh. Yeah, agh, I definitely can’t stand. I think I messed up my spine.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charlie rolled over onto his back so he was lying upwards facing the sky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Where’s the five kids with the gold tickets?” asked Charlie. “I can’t move. Send them here. Come here. Gather around my body.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The five lucky children approached Charlie.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mr. Bucket,” eeked out Harry Twixt, a scrappy orphan boy who found his golden ticket in a trash can. “I just want to say that I love this factory and your candy more than anything else in the whole wide–”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Shut up. Just shut up, ok? Agh. I’m in so much pain right now, kids. Just be quiet for a second.” Charlie took a few minutes to breathe while the children silently watched him. “Okay. Yeah, I can’t–I can’t do this chocolate factory tour, folks. It’s Harry. The orphan kid. The rest of you should go home. Harry, call me an ambulance. Here’s the keys to the factory. It’s yours.”</p>

1182,"Dear Historians,","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. Though the Lampoon rarely comments on current events, it feels wrong to continue making our silly jokes while the apocalypse is ongoing. So here’s what happened to Larry while he was hospitalized:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doctor: (rushing in) Buddy, there’s a cure but you’re not gonna like it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Larry: (wheezing) You mean I might live?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doctor: It involves grafting your body to that of a person with immunity.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Larry: Huh doc, I don’t know, I find the idea of grafting myself to another human being a little concerning.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doctor: If it helps at all Larry I can explain the operation with these props. This small model of yourself would be you, now watch as I amputate at the waist and attach the upper part of the model’s body to...  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Old Chinese Woman: 콱봤쳄쟝돨莖賈.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doctor: This would be your donor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Larry: I don’t know doc, you’re sure this is the only way I can beat this disease? This seems more like something a mad doctor would come up with rather than the official W.H.O. guidelines. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doctor: We have to operate now.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Larry: Hold on! Wait just a goddam second! For once! Let me think about if this counts as sex.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Old Chinese Woman: 乖角詭눌돨뇹큽.</span></p>

1192,Playwriting,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last Monday they caught me playwriting during detention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Well well well, what do we have here?” the teacher asked, having never seen stage directions before. “N-nothing” I replied, stuffing the play into my bag and taking out a longer play that was ready for edits. The cool kids teased me for writing plays. The cool kids wrote pilots.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“The fuck is up with all this profane-ass bullshit?” the teacher said, reading aloud my first line of dialogue. His face turned pale at my offense. A question mark with no question? I was wantonly disregarding the interrogative form.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Don’t worry teach, the principal is gonna </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">looove </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">this one” someone called out from the back. Everyone knew that Principal Adams was a huge theater geek. His support would mean social suicide.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Hold on guys, it’s just a play,” I said, reading the role of my lead Rocco, a playwright doing his best work in school classrooms. The crowd nodded sympathetically, even though my stage directions told them to nod ironically. In fairness, the directions were crossed-out, and worse, in a Courier condensed font, which no pilot writer reads.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Soon it was time for my punishment. I sullied up to the chalkboard and wrote ‘</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I won’t obsess over dialogue’ </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fifty times, with slightly different wording each time, until I found the one that sounded the most natural, the second, ‘I.. uh… like, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">no me obsesionaré con el diálogo’</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then I showed the class my novella. It was actually pretty good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

1193,"Excerpts From the Great American Novel","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was time for them to head west with just the shirts on their backs and the shirts on their legs. Remember AIDS? Reagan had blown that 1-0 lead. It was their turn now, but they were seeing spiders, man. The barista must have laced the LSD with coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They felt that American wind whip across their bright-light-big-city faces when they turned the AC on. It was time to play a lot of Springsteen, exclusively on cassette, completely unironically.&nbsp; They passed a group of college girls on a yellow school bus. Maybe they were in kindergarten. The zeitgeist was the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They passed through the hippie communes of California, and out of the two they liked the Las Vegas one better. They saw four cars and six hundred thousand people in California. Place was a carpooling miracle. The gang pulled the car over at the first sign that read </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">San Francisco</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a Spanish phrase meaning “pull over here, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">por favor</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They were tripping hard. By morning they made it to a campground. By noon they opened the car door. Each tent had one righteous babe named after a rock formation. Crystal was easy on the eyes. Grand Canyon had legs so long that each one could hold five hitchhikers and did. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was fucking the third girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Late into the night, the guys would ask each other, “What does any of this mean?” while parsing through a Tex Mex menu. Back then, the system was one big empanada, and the working man was churned into a delicious Latin goo. </span></p>

1196,"This Piece is Not Family Friendly","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I put on my poop shirt and then farted over to the boobs store. “One penis please,” I said, though all that came out of my mouth was beer covered in butts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Sure,” said the man offering me drugs at the counter, and then, “Whoops, actually I meant to say ‘shit’.” “No problem,” I said in between bites of my sandwich with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">normal</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> turkey in it. The bread was nipples.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once he finished diarrheaing the other customers he handed me my penis and I went to Underage Drinking Park, where I French kissed my sister. My dog finished humping my mom and then came over and handed me a thousand lit matches. “Sex,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unsure of what to do with the matches, I ran around holding a knife by the blade. It wasn’t until an hour into the run, when I opened my eyes, that I noticed my shoes were still tied. Embarrassed, I stopped running, bent down, and microwaved some aluminum foil.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I called my sister over to drive me home, but she was too busy staring directly at the sun while operating a bulldozer on Vicodin. My mom stopped smoking while pregnant long enough to walk over and give me some Lego bricks to swallow. I took this as my cue to go on CoolCowGames.com without permission.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Immediately upon opening my laptop I was messaged by several older people. Being underage, I of course replied with pictures of myself. It wasn’t long before my mom dragged me to the car by the handles of the plastic bag I’d put over my head at birth. We stopped at a pee-pee station on the way home so mom could refill the jizz tank of our car, which was shaped like a vagina (unshaved).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While my mom was fumbling with the house keys I watched all of </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Schindler’s List</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> without an adult. When she finally got the door open I ran to the couch and sat with my dad to stare directly at our industrial strobe lights. “Son,” he said, “you know I’ve never </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">actually</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> pulled quarters out from behind your ears, right? Those were just your hearing aids!” Then we laughed and I gave my father a hug. My </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">abusive</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> father, that is.</span></p>

1199,"The Time I Got Caught Milking","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One time I was at the farm, milking some cows when Bobby, the guy that owns the farm, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">comes out running towards me and says not that fucking kid, not that dirt bag fucking kid again. So </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bobby’s there waving his rifle at me and then my big brother lunges from the shrubs of our house—we were neighbors with Bobby at the time— and tries to disarm him and Bobby just shoots the guy, just like that boom, Mark my only sibling is dead, and I’m here just trying to collect my milk before Bobby gets to me too. So then my mom comes out from our house screaming ""what is this racket"" and she sees the body of her oldest child, her only son lying lifeless amongst the crops and she wails and wails but I try not to let it break my concentration because I’m milking those cows three gallons a minute at this point and I feel fucking unstoppable. Bobby’s stand-ing right in front of me now and he pulls up his rifle and points it right at my face when my mom runs between us to block him and pleads Bobby, please, ""not my only daughter Bobby"", ""she has behavioral disabilities Bobby"", and a bunch of white lies that I was kinda fine with given how close I was to finishing milking that cow. But Bobby’s in a fit of rage at this point, the guy’s losing his damn mind, and he </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">just knocks out my mom with his rifle, giving her an aneurysm that would do her in after a few weeks of internal bleeding. As Bobby continues sprinting towards me, he's getting so close now, I squirt a bit of milk onto his face, and the cold shock of that sublime celestial substance just snaps him out of his blind fury and he realizes what he's done to my mom, and Mark, and Bobby just cries, man—Bobby was my father, who had left the household in infancy to set up his business where I couldn't reach the cows—and he cries like a little baby and then shoots himself while asking the lord to please forgive him, which is kind of poetic actually because I've just sealed up the last of my milk jugs. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I was all alone after that day, no mom, no dad, no Mark, wandering the world aimlessly without a family to call alive, just me and my milk.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was actually pretty alright.</span></p>

1202,"The Woods","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I bring you out here at the end of summer every year. You notice that? My father did the same. My father was a weak man, credit wise, but he did what he had to do. I do what I have to do too. I’m here to show you how to catch a fish with your bare hands.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want you to run your hands through the water. Find anything? You were going too slow. Jenson Men have to be quick to survive. Jenson Men have to be quick if they want to eat. These fish are like a Jenson man. They’re hunted extensively by the wealthier folks from town.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clasp down on that one right there with two hands. Woah buddy, that’s not a fish. It’s a frog. Bite into it. Gross? No such thing as gross, son. Some people think they’re better than their prey. A top hunter knows he’s the same as his prey, just a little richer is all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Put your arm in that whirlpool and clench. All around you, fish are moving, playing a game of life and death, just like us Jenson men. Life and death, that’s the game everyone plays, isn’t it? Okay. Maybe not everyone, son, but people play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See the way that fish avoided your hands? You need some bait, kiddo! The best hunting bait is a low-to-no credit opportunity. Here’s some worm meat.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enjoy the quiet time you get out here, son. There’s nothing like the great outdoors, especially when the Wilkinson Estate begins their summer hunt. Not a Jenson Man in sight for the summer hunt. That’s how a Jensen man gets shot and mounted on a Wilkinson Man’s wall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lick the skin off this one, son. Catfish are bottom-feeders, but now don’t let that bother you. We don’t get to choose what part of the food chain we’re on. If we did, maybe I’d choose not to be hunted for sport by my fellow man. Maybe, I said, but maybe not.</p>

1206,"School Tour","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hey. Hey you. Yeah, you, freshman. Come here. Not so close. You want to see the real secrets this school has to offer? Follow me.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rumor has it this school was built on top of a cemetery for closeted lesbians. You know what that means? Exactly. Highly fertile soil. This passageway leads underneath the bleachers. And behind those bleachers? Grass. But underneath that grass? A hidden door. Behind that door is the principal’s office—and you can only guess what’s inside.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Look we’re already back in the lunchroom. Each group on campus has their own table- the cool kids, the centrists, the oblong, the wet and wilds. You don’t intermingle, unless you’re me. But you’re not me, not in this timeline at least.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stop drooling at that oil painting of the girl that died in a skiing accident and come into the auditorium. It’s fine to smoke in here as long as you don’t make eye contact with any of the teachers. We’re about to put on Peter Pan. You ever see Peter Pan? Me neither. He’s like a small elf boy with a bounty on his life—but that’s not important. Quick, come this way. Mrs. Silvers is coming, and I’m not allowed to be here after what happened at last year’s Nativity scene.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turn left. You’ve got to walk these halls like a prince. Watch this—that’s right, I just spray painted a haiku on that kid’s locker. He’s going to be smiling like a gentle fool all day. Oh great, the wet and wilds are here. Don’t acknowledge them or you’ll be damp all through next period.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">God, what I would give to be in your shoes. Senior year isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, at least not once you’ve discovered all the hidden trap doors and taken advanced Spanish. This place becomes kind of boring at that point. Oh, that was the bell. And hey—if you need me, I’ll be gluing together the pieces of the ceramic baby Jesus that I broke.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>-When you say “struggle,” I would replace it with a more positive word, like “character development.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Add some more context to the second paragraph. Right now, it looks like I abandoned you at the water park, which I would only do if there was a work emergency. And there was. I found that out after I got home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-This “my father” character sounds like a real jerk. Maybe use a different name? Any other name. Like “family member” or “paternal figure.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-That’s not how <em>I </em>remember your near-drowning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-I was drinking <em>diet </em>coke when I came to pick you up. I remember because the nurse said no outside drinks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Be sure to watch your verb tenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-In hindsight, “sink or swim” does sound a bit harsh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-Line 25. Find a way to spin this—for example, you now know how to perform CPR on yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-In my defense, I could only save one of you, and your brother can’t tread water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-I had no idea the therapist we got you was for your aquaphobia. I thought it was because you were having teen troubles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-There’s a spelling error in “attempted emancipation.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>-So… all those water polo games… our father-daughter synchronized diving routines… our family vacation to Venice? I am so sorry.</p>

1222,"The Trial of the Decade","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, it seemed certain that Marco would get lunch detention. Frank Lee, our principal, along with the entire student body, literally witnessed Marco throw the bag of flaming poop at Mrs. Pompeo during the morning assembly. But much like a carnival worker who knows how to operate the jaws of life when a ride malfunctions, sandwiching a child onto the tracks, I knew how to get people off. And luckily, Marco knew just where to find me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Come in and close the door. I don’t pay to heat the hallway,” I snarl at him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is your office? I didn’t expect it to be-”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To be what? The women’s locker room? I’m not gonna say it again. Close the door and sit down.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m not comfortable being here, man. There’s tons of girls here. P.E. meets this period.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jesus Marco, they <em>don’t </em>notice us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’re all staring at you and yelling at us to get out, dude.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Fine. We can meet in my conference room. Let’s hurry. Your trial with Principal Lee is next period.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things were off to a terrible start. This kid clearly didn’t have the charisma or name to weasel his way out of the grip of justice. He attempted to plead his case to me on the walk over to my conference room.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Keep your mouth shut until we’re in the room. You have no idea who the prosecution will call as a witness. Mrs. Pompeo could have ears all over this hallway.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hey as my lawyer aren’t you supposed to know who the witnesses are going to be?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like to keep the element of surprise on my side. We will both find out together during the trial. We’re here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re kidding. This is the conference room? But it’s the-”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Teacher’s Locker Room. That’s right.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I questioned Marco brutally for the remaining 30 minutes of the period. I came at him from every angle. “Did you throw the poop?! How did you throw the poop?! Is your name Marco?!” That sort of thing. Finally, I thought we might have built a case. If Marco was just able to somehow cram himself into a tiny jar, he could claim that it would be impossible for him to have thrown the poop because he was in a tiny little jar. We stopped outside Principal Lee’s door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Remember our defense. It’s airtight. All we can do now for your sake, Marco, is pray that the scales of justice were made in Mexico. They’ll tilt in favor of one of their descendents.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I promise you, dude. My family is Italian.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My apologies–<em>hecho en Mexico</em>,” I said, cutting him off.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ah hello Marco,” said Principal Lee. “And you, unnamed lawyer kid, you’re not really supposed to be here but this’ll be fast so I suppose you can stay. Marco did you throw the poop?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ok. I’m afraid I’ll have to give you lunch detention.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ehem. Sidebar, Marco. Despite what I promised earlier, I actually do get paid whether we win or lose the trial.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We started towards the door, my head held high, Marco crying about something or other.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh and one more thing, Marco,” Principal Lee said. “Coach Stevens told me you missed P.E. today and so I’m afraid-”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Another day of lunch detention?” Marco choked out through tears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

1224,"Dropping My D-Hall Tray","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>No, dude. No no no no this is not happening right now</em>. I’ve lightly grazed the doorframe on my way out of the food serving area into the food eating area. I watch with horror one of my three cups of Diet Coke sliding mercilessly to the right in slow motion. <em>Everything on my tray is for real gonna frickin fall. </em>I look out to the dining hall. <em>Oh my Jesus dang. </em>Every single girl I have ever had a crush on is sitting here in Adams Dining Hall, picking at their Beef Saigon, staring at me. <em>Half of these girls don’t even go to Harvard, </em>I think to myself. <em>What the flip is happening?!&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What?! Nobody makes time to have a conversation these days anymore?! You’re all just gonna stare at me while my tray slowly flips out of my hands and lands on the floor?!” I scream out at everyone, causing even more people to look up. Slowly but surely the Diet Coke glass makes it to the end of the tray and begins teetering back and forth on the edge. Will it fall? Will I be socially disgraced?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Think, Mike. Just think. What would my role model and namesake, Mr Tyson, do? </em>I notice the lunch lady who swiped me in just to my left. <em>It’s a long shot, but sometimes you’ve just gotta GO for it!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve dumped my entire tray on her head. Two bowls of oatmeal, nearly a liter of Diet Coke, 6 heaping plates of Morrocan carrot salad, enough ranger cookies to turn Usain Bolt into a diabetic, all over this poor woman’s head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Roll with it, Mike. Tyson wouldn’t back now he would, hell he would bite an ear off for God’s sake. He would uh….</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*SMACK* “Looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the getting hit in the face with my tray this morning,” I nervously quip to the entire dining hall after hitting the lunch lady with my tray across the face again and again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Oh my god. Literally everyone is about to laugh at me. Why do I keep making this worse?</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Excuse me, son.” A man in a suit approaches me, gesturing at me to stop hitting the woman with my tray. “I saw what you did back there with the throwing all your food on that person and then hitting them with your tray.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh, um, yeppo I guess I did that!” <em>Yeppo? What the frick is yeppo I don’t say that.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We could use someone with your quick decision making skills. Have you heard of NASA?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sir,” I say, staring deeply into his eyes, “No. Get out of my way.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I run back to my room in shame. Everyone saw me drop my dining hall tray today. I’ll be a pariah for the rest of my life. I can’t wait to get back to my room, turn on Mike Tyson talk show interview montages, and just forget about life for a while.</p>

1228,"No More Sheriffs","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Happy Saturday everyone – good to see you at the town meeting. All our sheriffs died last night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by acknowledging the empty podium next to mine. As you all know, this child-sized plastic podium belongs to Sheriff Sharif, my second in command. Sadly Sheriff Sharif is not with us today – he is observing the Islamic sabbath after all. This is very unlike all the other sheriffs who were torn apart by a train last night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This train entered the town at approximately twenty-two hundred – and that’s pretty heavy for a train if you ask me. I’m not sure how it made it past the anti-train security we installed last year. Somehow it plowed through all 20,053 damsels tied up on the tracks, 1,085,768,231 damsels dressed as scarecrows, 9,999,999,999,999.97 damsels armed with water bottles to spray at the train’s whiskers, and the 3 <em>Old Man Damsel’s Damsel Emporium</em> franchises that we erected on the train tracks. At this point I should say that all the town’s women are also dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the six days it took for this evil train to sneak past our security, the sheriffs wasted no time getting to work – after all somebody had to enforce our Jim Crow laws. Once the sheriffs were back on the street all seemed at peace, what with the women gone. They couldn’t have possibly imagined the event that would rock our town and destroy the rule of law: the passing of the Civil Rights Act. Thank God that turned out to be a big prank and the sheriffs quickly caught the high schoolers responsible for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little did they know that those high schoolers were actually little train cars, which assembled into a larger train car, which called up a few train car friends and combined into a larger train, which was part of an even LARGER prank by the rival high school. The sheriffs arrested these hoodlums too, and it’s comforting to know how dedicated they were to the law before being plowed over, internally decapitated, dismembered, re-membered, dismembered again, and having their skin and sinew be twisted and ripped off by a hellish train at the conclusion of a large battle, metaphorically speaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sheriffs decided to visit a bar in our neighboring town to celebrate the imprisonment of all those children. The next train heading there was fiery, gnarled, and covered in the blood of millions of women, as a result of our town’s poor train maintenance. They instead boarded the train after that which was the evil one. This was the last time they were seen alive, as shortly after their trip began they were struck by another unrelated train and quietly passed away. Sheriff Williams was the only survivor, but this morning, after a long battle with cancer, he was shot to death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things may seem dire, but know that we will get through this tough time, and the law will always live on in our town. That being said I have just been informed that Sheriff Sharif is dead. Thank you all for coming. God bless. USA USA USA.</p>

<p>Readers, we would like to retract a statement we made in our most recent issue. After multiple online scientists reached out to us, we now realize it is not factual to state that a squid could “chokeslam any whale, any day, any place and time a squid could body a bitch-ass whale like it’s nobody’s business.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has come to our attention that a squid’s tentacles likely could not wrap around the neck of an adult whale; certainly not with enough force to chokeslam. We’re honestly not sure if whales even have necks, as we’re a magazine about squids. The rest of the magazine was 100% factually accurate and we stand by everything we said about Secretary Clinton’s role in the events that took place in Benghazi. Happy hunting! </p>

<p>Listen bro I totally get where you’re coming from, but just remember that next time you point a finger at Israel, there’s gonna be three fingers pointing right back at you. You know what I mean? It’s kind of like, if you live in a glass house, you’re probably better off not throwing stones, right? All I’m saying is that nobody is perfect—God knows I’m no saint—and that sometimes you’ve got to take into account the principle of charity and consider things from a different perspective. I mean, that’s empathy, right? Remember that David Foster Wallace quote I texted you the other day—the one about the healing power of identifying with someone else’s pain? I think this is exactly the kind of situation that he had in mind when he said that. Here I’m pulling up the quote now. “But if a piece of fiction can allow us to imaginatively identify with a character's pain, we might then also more easily conceive of others identifying with our-” Holy shit dude. Have you ever thought about reading a book about Israel? I’m serious. I honestly think that would help. Because, like, right now, you’re judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree, so it’s a no-brainer that you’re gonna find some areas to criticize. Fuck actually you know what you should do? I’m gonna send you a putlocker link to this “Parts Unknown” episode where Bourdain—may God rest his soul—visits Israel and eats a ton of this super delicious-looking shakshouka. I think you’d find it really eye-opening. Obviously it’s not gonna change your entire worldview or anything, but I think it might just give you a different perspective, you know?</p>

<p>Oh, sure. Back me up further to the edge of the boat. I don’t mind. Are you pissed? You seem pissed. Can we talk about why you’re mad? Because it seems like you’re mad because - look, I know I left some whale remnants out in the open on the deck to attract seagulls and then caught all the seagulls, a whole flock of them, and put them down in the sleeping quarters and glued them to the floor. I put the glue right on their feet. Then I said I was the king of the gulls and killed the captain. Then you all voted for a second new captain and I played along for a little bit, biding my time sowing seeds of dissent amongst my gulls, then I killed him too. The thing about these gulls is they didn’t respect me as a king up until the second assassination. And it’s like, they’re glued on the ground, you know? So why are they being so picky? I could name any one of you captain right now and kill you, then they’d all flock around me like I did something soooo great, except they wouldn’t move since the glue and all. Any one of you I could kill. If I were you I’d be more pissed at the gulls than at me. You wouldn’t blame a toe? Would you? In the same way you shouldn’t blame the king of the gulls for a little bit of glue ending up on a lot of gulls’ feet and maybe one or two captains gone. And to be honest we get more money now that they’re gone. So you should be thanking me, really, instead of tossing me off the edge of this boat. Glue’s not cheap either. It’s technically illegal for you to do this to me, you know, since none of you are captain. If one of you were to step up right now and declare yourself captain then I guess it would be fine, but I think we all know why you aren’t going to do that. But toss me off the edge, or whatever. I don’t care.</p>

<p>Many of you have decided, for whatever idiotic reason, to send in fan-mail and questions to the Lampoon offices.  On my way up to the trampoline room from a nice soak and sauna in the Lampoon baths, I just so happened to come across one of these bags of mail. I suspect someone meant to throw these letters out along with the stack of bills from the trampoline cleaning service and the dead freshman they were next to. Nonetheless, after an invigorating bounce, I’ve decided to take this bag into the Deep Writing Bunker.  With me is the trusty Lampoon servant and funnyman Jingles the Monkey, to whom I am dictating your answers. </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A: First of all, don’t get into comedy writing unless you love fast cars, money, and all the sex you can wish for. It takes a certain kind of person to live the college comedy writer lifestyle, to live la vida loca. To your second question: my writing partners and I, we rise at 5 with the sun.

<p>Host: Hello and welcome back to Queer on the Frontier: the show that examines cultural representations of the gay cowboy.&nbsp; [theme music]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For many, the Cowboy is a figure of raw, unbridled masculinity. A rugged hero and a self-made man, the cowboy sits at the center of a mythical frontier that enchants the imagination of Hollywood and society.&nbsp; Yet, in recent years, this idea has come more and more under scrutiny as new interpretations of the Cowboy have come to light, along with new understandings of those classic heroes of the Wild West we all know and treasure.&nbsp; We set out to understand: how queer was the nineteenth-century frontier?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host: I’m here in Wyoming’s Big Horn Mountain range, a little over a hundred years ago this remote plain was home to all manner of cowboys and outlaws.&nbsp; These passes behind me were the hideout of history’s most infamous western gang: the Hole in the Wall Gang.&nbsp; Now, it’s a tourist destination where travelers from all over can stay in traditional rustic cabins, ‘take ther boots off,’ ‘help themselves to the beans in the pot,’ and learn what it meant to be a cowboy of old.&nbsp; I’m joined here by a Larry Laffer, proprietor of the Hole in the Wall Lodge &amp; Adventures, how are you doing today Larry, or should I say ‘how was the trails, partner?’&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry: Aw well any day above ground is a good day I always say.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host: (chuckles) Fantastic, that’s great Larry.&nbsp; Now tell me, what led you to take up this rugged life out here on the range.&nbsp; Was it the thrill of adventure, the intoxicating allure of the striking cowboy figure, or were you running away from something, somebody, or perhaps even yourself?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry:&nbsp; Well, (spits) no in fact I wasn’t always a cowboy, used to be just like any other feller I suspect, grinding my axe down to a little nub.&nbsp; Thens, I saw a little picture at the movies about the old desperados and whatnot and, I guess I just decided I’d had my fill of all the hullabaloo.&nbsp; So, I came out here and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.&nbsp; I guess you could say I took to the life of a cowboy like a horse takes to oats.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host:&nbsp; That’s fascinating Larry.&nbsp; Now you’re kind of famous around here for your, well how do I say it, for a certain ‘flair’ you bring to the cowboy life, would you mind talking about that?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry: Ma whut now?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host: Your purple suit for one, it’s not quite traditional cowboy attire is it?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry:&nbsp; Ma suit?&nbsp; Well, I guess yeah it is a little different from the usual digs.&nbsp; But it protects my back when the sun is beating down on me and keeps me warm at night all the same, and that’s all you can ask for.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host:&nbsp; And your bedazzled boots, (camera pans down to boots) those are spectacular where did you get those?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry:&nbsp; Well these, one of my pals up here made me these seein as my others were gettin a little tattered, in fact these just one of a matchin pair, the other bein on his little dogs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host: Speak more on these chaps you’re wearing Larry, they certainly are something.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry: Yea-ah, well they wasn’t always like that.&nbsp; In fact, when I first purchased them they wasn’t havin the holes in the back and they was just normal chaps.&nbsp; I done worn em down with riding and such and scritchin my behind on the rocks when I git a little itchy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Host:&nbsp; Incredible. (turns to camera) And so we see that even out here in the remote hills of the west, even that archetypal image of manhood can be recast in a manner that jeopardizes the cowboy’s standing in a testosterone-driven, heterosexual culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry inhaled for a second, let the shivers pass, and proceeded to wipe the spunk off the glossy mag with his shirt. It didn’t not not work,<br>and would have, under circumstances slightly altered, perhaps even been deemed a success, but in this actual world (ours), Larry’s low-PH ejaculate had cleft ink from paper, unsticking chemical bonds not meant unstuck, and Larry had succeeded in little more than screen-print-<br>ing a pair of gorgeous Kalahari saggers from his dentist’s waiting room’s copy of last years’ National Geographic onto his very best polyester button-down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>The receptionist cleared her throat. “Are you done, sir?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>“Oh yeah, absolutely, thanks, miss.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Soon as Larry walked out of the office, he realized he’d left his visor in there, but Larry was willing to bet that that receptionist wasn’t going to let him back in before she was done scraping trace ejaculate + CMYK ink residue from a now blank, denuded page of Nat Geo (to make Cyan,<br>Magenta, Yellow, and blacK little in-vitro Larries, no doubt), so really he might as well just get the visor back whenever the tooth falls out again and he has to get it re-grafted.<br>Larry checked his voicemail. Oof. Headache. Another hour-long missive from the dame in charge of setting up his new fanpage, a former friend of his, who was up to her ears in work (low bar, her ears, since she weighed them lobes down with lead clamps because something about ele-<br>phants being a symbol of longevity in certain cultures, apparently). A hundred thousand Uyghurs, all houseguests of hers, making an absolute mess of her living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“… anyway, I’m trying to keep them happy by just playing this new song I wrote called Loops on a loop in my living room, full blast, but honestly, I don’t think it’s working, and they’re just all very very unhappy…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This friend, of course, neglected to mention that they were being kept there under circumstances deemed “murky at best” by the International Court of Justice and “pretty much standard” by the head of the Chinese Communist Party, acclaimed wuxia star Jackie Chan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Larry sighed. There was a traffic jam along the conveyor belt sidewalk, and it would take him at least an hour to get to his pad uptown. It was really late in China, and he’d promised Jackie that he’d log into Chunky Trollcraft, an MMORPG they both played, before Chan’s bedtime, but it<br>didn’t look like he was going to make it.</p>

Larry saw the flashes as the troposphere lit on fire, the sounds the bombs made as they eradicated life on earth: a sucking, an obscene sound This sound reminded Larry of breathing, or fucking, or breathing pretty hard while fucking, or an old horse trying to drink through a straw. Larry made little noises for each prick of light, for each 50-megaton ignition— pew, pwang, pew pew pew, pshhhheeeeeeeaaaaawwza. Larry was there, on the faux sand of the hottest new party spot on the strip, droopy Panama hat on his head and cocktail parosal in his drink. A single thought bounced around in his skull: “could really go for another one of these lemonade coolers.” He felt the sand under his feet warm and he watched the annihilation of the world and thought about what he would do to-mo-rr-ow as the sky began to hum.</p>

<p>Sitting handcuffed in the interrogation room, I started to sweat. They had the room at a cool 65, but I was wearing lots of layers. I asked the police officer if I could take them off and he said yes, but then I got too cold and he wouldn’t let me put any back on.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My best friend Tommy was in the other room, probably getting the same treatment. But Tommy was a weak-willed coward, and these cops knew it. I told them on the ride over. I couldn’t take the chance that he was going to snitch on me, and the only way to stop him was to snitch on myself first. I could only imagine what they were doing to Tommy, probably torturing him or talking to him sternly. Tommy hated being tortured.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The detective came in and I told him I wanted to confess. He told me that Tommy had already admitted to everything, that bastard. That was messed up for him to say because Tommy was raised by a single father and we had robbed the bank together.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Please, detective. I robbed the bank all by myself,” I pleaded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sure, and I’m supposed to have a license for this thing,” he said, firing three bullets into the wall before leaving the room.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I carved my confession into the table with a swiss army knife after drafting it using the pen and paper they had left. The officers were playing tricks with my mind, not even using my real name, instead referring to me as “vague accomplice” or “the innocent one.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After what I thought was two days but was really four hours according to my digital watch, the detective came in to let me go. Tommy was going away for a long time, but I was being set free. It looked like my confession had worked, for now. Two weeks later I was arrested for loitering and was sentenced to death, alongside my best friend.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, this is your CEO. Please keep mining; no reason to be alarmed. I am aware of the recent rumors about extraterrestrial life in the vicinity. I am also aware that you all are planning a mutiny as I make this announcement. And if you think I don’t know about the tunneling that’s been going on directly beneath HQ, in an attempt to destroy the building from below, you’re dead wrong. As for the bomb in our town square, ticking down from three minutes, I realize it’s there and I recognize that it’s a problem. In light of all this, and of the fact that the moon is now officially for sale, I am concerned. Mr. Steinbeck once wrote that the moon was down, and now even today it still is. We are out of water. We are out of oxygen. We are out of food. We are about to explode from multiple sources. I have been told that the earth doesn’t like us any more. That is regrettable. We might as well turn in folks. The coffee machine doesn’t work as well as it used to. The snacks in the break room recently lack nutrients. Outside is a bit too cold now. I wish we had more friends here.</p>

Mr. Patterson held up his hand as if to say “Let’s hear this guy out.” Then Stewart slowly lifted one foot off the desk. He was a little wobbly, but he found his balance. No one was laughing now. This Nobody WhatsHisName suddenly had the attention of the whole class. Stewart’s other foot came off the desk, and he started floating like a skydiver. People began to whisper. Stewart floated around the room with pretty minimal control, gently bumping into people’s heads and saying “Sorry. Whoops, sorry about that.” Eventually he asked to go to the nurse.

They put it on me once I was buckled into my $350 D-box personal vibrator seat. Before I had the first pound of smooth C-3PO flavored butter in my fist I was already ripping shards into my mom’s jeans, which I was wearing since I had shit in my own jeans two years earlier.

<p>Why should anyone care about algorithms? Let me answer that question with an algorithm because the answer to all of our questions is an algorithm. When I get lost, I ask myself, “What would an algorithm do?” Then I stand at the fork in the road, frozen, as it hits me that sometimes life gives you bananas and you forget to cut them down into smaller sub pieces and end up just eating the banana whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve been grappling with my own relationship with algorithms my whole life and recently published an untitled ebook on this topic. Writing this ebook was very hard, but with the help and support of algorithms, I was able to do it. Thank you algorithms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You see, everything is simultaneously the input and output of algorithms. I inputted most of my life into writing my ebook, and the output of that was zero in terms of readers but one in terms of self confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a way, algorithms are our supreme mother and father and we are their children. I sort of wish my algorithms had been a bit more nurturing, but it’s not like I’m traumatized or anything. Now that I found the self-love and self-hug algorithms, I don’t need my real parents anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the day, I know there will always be many algorithms I don’t understand like the sex algorithm. But I think I’m getting closer to the answer. Spoiler alert, the answer to that will probably be an algorithm.</p>

1324,"The C5 Beer Pong Table Piece","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So you’re in the market for a custom Beer Pong Table, preferably in the C4 through C6 range, but you don’t know where to buy it? You’re reading a paid advertisement, but you’re a busy person who really likes the idea of a custom beer pong table and you want us to get to the point? Well we have <em>just the thing for you.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s the worst part of every single custom beer pong table you’ve ever purchased? Easy: <em>you didn’t have to design it yourself. </em>The C5 Custom Beer Pong Table fixes this problem. The C5 Custom Beer Pong Table is everything you’ve ever dreamed of and more. We take your designs, and we build them into a beer pong table that could be used for studying, hitting the books, reading up on the daily news, and in case of emergency: to play Beer Pong.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tables are handcrafted by the legions of frat lords we have working in our Chicago sweatshops for maximum wage ($200,000 an hour, very reasonable). The paddles are carved from old pirate swords we stole from the Natural History Museum. The balls are from Home Depot. Each table is cut using domestically grown poplar wood and carefully assembled using sugar glue, which is a kind of candy glue Mikey crafted himself by combining regular glue with Fun Dip. It dissolves instantly in water. Mikey is the son of our CEO, and he makes many of the creative decisions instrumental to making the C5 Custom Beer Pong Tables unique. Mikey is seven, but he insists he’s “this many.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the C5 Custom Beer Pong Table is built, it is refined and customized to each customer’s exact specifications. For instance, if you were Steve Aoki and you wanted to make a giant chrome beer pong table with your name on it, we could do that. We actually did that, and now we’re best friends with Steve Aoki. His phone number is 372-272-4372. Please don’t tell him we gave it to you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, you don’t believe us because we’re the people who make and use custom beer pong tables and have an instinctual bias when trying to sell them to you? We don’t have time to address your trust issues, so listen to the reviews of our satisfied customers:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Jake Bartley, 16 - </em></strong>“Yeah, I bought the table as a prank on my parents after I took a credit card from my mom’s wallet, called the guys at C5 Custom Beer Pong Tables, gave them my direct specifications for a red and black Beer Pong table with racing stripes, entered my mom’s credit card information, waited a reasonable amount of time, then received the custom beer pong table in the mail, but it turned out to be really cool and my parents and I are on better terms now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Corey Fruge, 65 - </em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>“I used to just be the old guy in the neighborhood. The guy who ‘lived in his ex-wife’s front lawn for fifteen years, not including summers.’ Ever since I customized a C5 beer pong table, I’m the talk of the town. All the kids come to see if they can outdrink and outshoot Old Man Mister Fruge. Turns out… they can. I’m actually really bad at beer pong on account of me being so old and it being a game for young people.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Todd Widdle, 25 - </em></strong>“User review? It’s a beer pong table. I use it for beer pong. It is no better or worse than any of the other beer pong tables I’ve had. Well I guess the custom design is pretty dope… the ball and cup holder is also pretty nice…the price ain’t bad neither...”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Ivan Pierre, 25 - </em></strong>“When I was growing up in war-torn Milwaukee, Beer Pong was a game for the social elites and the monetarily privileged. It wasn’t something us common folk played. Now, with the Custom C5 Beer Pong Table at my disposal, I’m able to safely watch my rich friends play beer pong on a table designed to their exact specifications while I serve them drinks for a minimum wage salary.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>One Take Mike, 27 - </em></strong>“If C4 is the bomb, then C5 is the pong. Fuuuuck... Wait let me start over, that didn’t make sense. No seriously. Do not put that C4 bomb quote in the ad. Say instead that I said something cool like “C5 Custom Beer Pong tables have helped me rekindle my relationship with my estranged alcoholic mother”. I don’t know, some shit like that. Can we start over?”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>I. C. Weiner, 23 - </em></strong>“You’re gonna put my name in the ad right?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Darnell Croswell, 32 - </em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>“The Custom Beer Pong Table by C5 changes where, how, and why I play beer pong. It used to be I’d just start up a game when I was waiting for my toaster strudel to heat up. Ya know, the ‘ol 7-8am beer pong shift in the Croswell household. Now that I’ve got a custom table that heats up my strudel for me, I just play beer pong on special occasions. That’s right: weddings and funerals, baby. Nothing else.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Former Convicted Arsonist, 45 - </em></strong>“I like fire for one reason. It’s bright and reminds me of cigarettes. I like beer pong because it helps me forget my desire to burn things. I got my new C5 custom beer pong table with a flame decal on it, so that now I can do two of my favorite things at once. The bright LED lights on the table even make it look like the tables ablaze. I would trade all of the Keystone in the world for a lighter right now. But if I’m stuck with this sick custom beer pong table, I guess that’s okay too.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Jackson 5, 24 - </em></strong>“When Sigma Chi got all that money from our annual charity car wash, we knew exactly what to do with it: buy a new beer pong table. Our old one was broken from all the amateur wrestling we did on it, so we called up the guys at C5 and asked for a table that we could wrestle on, play beer pong on, and more importantly: one with a hidden compartment to store our cups and balls. The Sigma Chi bros are notorious for losing our cups and balls. Little did we know they would also customize it to be exactly the color and shape of the Sigma Chi house, which is coincidentally shaped like a pretty sick beer pong table.&nbsp;</p>

1326,"The Taco Bell on Beverly","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Where are you going?” you ask the homeless man wandering down San Vicente. “Don’t you know the&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>way?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You enter&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;through the discarded-soda-cup-and-cheesy-vomit garden, faded chalk-lines demarcating parking-spaces for cars hoping to get keyed, the prodigious Beverly Center looming overhead. Your hand cannot properly grip the door handle because the door handle is too oily. No worries, the heavily armed and extremely stoned Security Guard sees you struggling. As he pulls the door open, you catch a glimpse of the Batman logo proudly embossed on his Glock 17. “Uh, cool Batman gun,” you tell him. “I think blind-people jokes are okay as long they’re one-hundred-percent visual,” he replies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take your place at the back of the line, behind the miscellaneous hobos, flobos, worm-people, and other creatures of the night; the pre-prandial atmosphere is one of impermanence: soon, most of these people will die of causes both unnatural (e.g. prostitute-related homicide) or subnatural (e.g.&nbsp;Taco-Bell-related cardiac resignation, i.e., the soft language term for cardiac defeat). The line moves slowly because the&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;employees keep arguing with each other: “I think it’s immoral to name hurricanes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think it’s okay to name the hurricanes that have souls.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think buildings are so tall because the government does not want us to see hurricanes coming.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You wait. The air is thick with beef-smoke. A colorblind man reorganizes the sauce packets by color. A lush display of aquatic flora cultured in the slurp machine drifts in mountain dew tide. Someone stares vacantly at the non-gendered bathroom, trying to remember what their gender was without the help of a sign. A seascape painter stands at his easel, the drugs pumping through his blood make him think he’s a photographer. A high-chair sits in the corner packed with trash.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you’re at the register. Now, your eyes are darting from the cashier’s crickety face to the effulgent polychrome menu above. The&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;menu is structured like a fractal — burritos within quesadillas within empanadas within burritos, an infinitely iterating series of Tex-Mex, an edible matryoshka. “Uh, can you describe the grandee fiesta crunch-melt supreme?” you croak. The cashier answers by reciting a series of adjectives you’ve never heard before. Sounds good: you’ll take one. The order comes to $2.75: a great deal considering what Yum Foods pays to smuggle the food-synthesizing-chemicals into your country. You swipe a few credit cards until you find one that works and sign the liability waiver.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sit and listen for your number to be called. A sunburned man in a raincoat tells his crying daughter her tears are making her eyeliner run. The customers’ wheezings are momentarily drowned out by the woosh of F-16s tearing through the sky, migrating to the warzone. The store’s rice-and-lettuce sweeper finishes his sweeping, unplugs his machine, and retreats back into his office, letting out a coyote who snakes through legs and arrives at the window to contemplate the Lenscrafters across Beverly Blvd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A customer’s pleas for an enchirito that’s just an enchilada are silenced by the cashier’s ringing phone. He nods, sighs, drags himself to the Employee of the Month board, and moves the grease-stained photo of a smiling man to the adjacent In Memoriam board.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The runny-nosed chef brings your food — a rainbow of dehydrated-mystery-clots swaddled loose in a grey tortilla submerged in cloudy sludge all topped with an impasto of Dorito dust — and hastily proceeds to the emergency eyewash station. “Mama Mi!” you announce sardonically to no one in particular. Sure enough, no one’s listening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sulfuric smell awakens your olfaction, which the doctor presumed dead after your last&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;encounter. Your index finger probes the Grande Fiesta, pierces through the Crunch Melt, and scours the depths of the lumpish Supreme, looking for a point of edibility. You traverse the spice gradient — a&nbsp;gustatory&nbsp;Ahab in virulent tides. Eventually, amidst the grain and gristle, a masticable pulp emerges. Fight instinct’s protest; allow it entry into your salivary chamber where it’s all systems go… glands springing into action, tongue writhing, tastebuds calibrating and recalibrating to interpret the&nbsp;Daedalian&nbsp;codices inscribed on&nbsp;San Bernardino concrete&nbsp;by Swiss nutritionist&nbsp;Glen William&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;Jr. Your mouth is the aether through which an acrid&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;galaxy forms, cosmic fast food inflation, space-time: a sodium rhythm, subdivided chloride integers. It is an inhospitable place. Palate aglow, uvula swaying in pungent winds, glutamate rivulets cascading down oropharynx, a peppery conquest expediting esophageal senescence,intestines shuttering with anticipatory fear (i.e. dread).&nbsp;One bite in and you can already feel your digestive system accordionizing, anal discharge agglomerating, arteries constricting, blood gelatinizing. As your body’s Flavour Levels soar, the resulting hypoxia brings a prophetic hallucination: Red Sands 2: Mummies Undercover loses Best Picture to the film adaptation of Jennifer Egan’s Manhattan Beach. You blink and are back in your chair, back under industrial fluorescent-lights and mottled ceiling panels. Catch your breath. You good? Now take a second bite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;menu&nbsp;causeth my head to ache” chess prodigy Mangus Carlsen announces to the restaurant, before a corps of G-Men smash through the windows, wrestle Carlsen to the ground, zip tie his fingers to his hands, his hands to his wrists, and his wrists to his wrists, and drag him into a van sitting out front. Little do they know they’ve got the wrong guy — they didn’t see Mangus castle with the homeless man to his left.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time is real hazy. There’re three clocks about the place, but all of them move at different speeds and the ticking sound is not coming from any of them. The sun might be rising or there might be a helicopter searchlight fixed on the restaurant. As you gnaw at more of the GFCMS, some cold liquid runs down your leg. Your chair must be leaking.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Um, does anyone have an&nbsp;<em>estra</em>&nbsp;wheelchair?” you ask the three guys sitting at the adjacent handicapped table.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Take mine,” offers the chunky guy with the chalk handprint on his blazer. “I have to leave anyway. My family does&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;franchising and this location is their enemy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you rise from your seat, the angle of HVAC vent aligns perfectly with your vision. Notice the two eyes staring back at you from behind those grates. Quickly they deflect your gaze, pupils running bashful saccades about the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the time it takes you to switch out the chair, your questionably nutritive comestible has transmogrified into a lumpy paste that’s too hot to eat and getting hotter. It’s also begun to radiate light. It’s brightening — it’s like a guided missile. The chef slides over the counter and vaults several tables to get to you. He jabs at the moory clump with his knife, frenzied, fear in his eyes. The dish screams as pressure and mucus escape its lacerated integument, its wails resonating in perfect diatonic harmony (you have perfect pitch, remember?). “Phew” sighs the chef, wrests his knife from the stubborn bleb’s stubborn grip, and waddles back to the kitchen to continue cutting up yearbook photos for fake IDs.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The icecaps melt a little more. Mercury reverses its direction of orbit: there will be no retrograde this cycle. The average wait-time to use the coin-operated EKG lengthens as more corpulent blobs queue up. Oof — suddenly, you are panicking: some apparition has announced its presence, a turbulent susurrus slipping through the laminar flow of reality, vortices of ruin, gloom, shame, grief, loneliness, anguish, misting through the mexican-inspired eatery, coalescing and diverging, churning every fiber of your being, you deliquesce in its charnel whirl. And it’s not just you: a metachronous shudder billows over the clientele and employees alike, their eyes throb, pupils quiver in horrified rictus, minds unwind to comprehend the vast vacuity confronting them, wrapping them in its invisible tendrils. You know this unwelcome obtrusion is Evil itself, a specter of imminent doom, the Gnostic aura lurking at the depths of all suffering. Then, upon colliding with the PepsiCo effluvium, the tenebrous blur reverses direction, and gingerly withdraws back into the abyss before you’ve even had the chance to say goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Murmurs fill the vacancy: “I like regular fries but my baby likes sweet potato fries so now I have to get two types of fries and it’s starting to get expensive” a pregnant woman chirps to her bewhiskered friend; “If you come home with me, you can try on some of my mom’s pants” a stringy-limbed man propositions a woman lathered in cosmetics; “What’m I supposed to do with this grenade I found?” the world’s tallest midget asks the cashier who wastes no time retrieving a box from below the counter with “Lost and Found” majusculed on the front, filled mostly with needles (used).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By now, you’ve pretty much assimilated your GFCMS. Hear your intestines howl (a noise akin to the carving of wood beams with a hacksaw), feel them twist and constrict, sludge peristalsing to steatorrheic goop which fills your anus’s antechamber. Clench your butt-muscles; ullage is waning. Move fast; the toilets here can’t be trusted. As you make for the exit, a&nbsp;Tacobell&nbsp;employee stops you, sniffles for you to call the number on the bottom of your receipt and take a customer satisfaction survey. What you can’t tell from this interaction is that, alone in his Lincoln-Heights Apartment, this man is a piano virtuoso of the highest order, a regular Chris Kyle on the keys — soaring nocturnes escape his trash-bag-curtained windows to relume the pallid South Central evenings, melodies and harmonies woven into glittering aural tapestries that hang in the air, drawing the usual LA cretins out of their gutters to congregate in the street and bask in acoustic reverie.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clutching your chemically-ravaged stomach, you slither to your vehicle (1996 Toyota Yaris, Banana Brown finish) and start up the engine. Make sure to wipe the ash off the windshield before you get going. As you pull out, the radio sputters on: Emblem3’s Chloe (You’re The One I Want) comes crackling through the speakers, the soulful vocals occasionally dimmed by interference from an encrypted U-Boat broadcast swimming in the airwaves. Curve along the neon kilometers of Beverly Boulevard, careful to avoid the barnacle-covered man lying in the middle of the road outside Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His squeals, “Help!” and “Help me!” resound for several blocks, then stop abruptly. You drive on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turning onto N. Santa Monica Boulevard causes spacetime to shrivel in the miasma of Beverly-Hills-luxury. Fun fact: it was in this boutique-necropolis that Julia Roberts bought her outfits in the film&nbsp;<em>Pretty Woman</em>. The glamour is putrid and burns your eyes — oh, how badly you want to speed up. And that’s not to mention the massive poop demanding emancipation from your body-sewer (you’re still weighing whether relieving the enormous pain of severe bowel congestion would be worth having to finish the drive sitting in your own purged liquid, the molten defecation seeping into and through your $85 ironic lighthouse pants). But if the rusty Honda Integra in your mirror is tailing you like you suspect, you don’t wanna risk it losing track of you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon, you’re driving up The Flats. A block south of Sunset, you arrive at a&nbsp;✺-junction at the same time as 15 other cars. It’s an automotive standoff: who’ll be the first one through the intersection? You wait. Five suspense-hemorrhaging minutes. Or maybe ten — you honestly aren’t keeping track. Someone’s gotta make a move though, and there’s no reason why that someone can’t be you. So go ahead, assume the right of way: be the Howard Roark of the intersection. You give the Yaris some gas. Wait, no, stop. Everyone, all 16 cars hit their gas at once, the geometric relation between them shrinks isometrically. Seeing 15 other cars converge on the same point occasions you — and, as it so happens, every other driver implicated in this impromptu vehicular hivemind — to brake. But now everyone else is stopping in unison, too; they all must be pausing so you can go... is the conclusion each driver reaches separately, simultaneously. And you all accelerate again. Hmm. This perfectly synchronized dance of gas pedals and brake lights continues until the hood of every car is inches from the hood of every other car. If anyone comes any closer, the logistics of the crash could be enough to drive your insurance agent to suicide (pun intended, maybe). This dilemma could be more Nietzschean than Randian, and it’s up to the Ubermenschiest guy/gal here to rise above these all-too-human normies and bestow upon them a new Rule Of The Road so the whole species of man can get to where it’s going. This responsibility falls to you (duh): it is you who’s crossed the hardshell bridge of suffering and emerged like radiant baja blast from its opaque container, you are the one brave enough to live on the precipice of fecal explosion, again and again you self-overcome. Speak thus and your disciples will listen. The clunk of your car door opening is accompanied by the clunk of 15 additional car doors opening. You and the other drivers form a tight circle in the middle of the street. Maybe speak louder so your roadside sermon will be heard over the cacophony of mass pontification? It’s no use. Now, you’re all just looking at each other; in this portentous silence, impatience mutates to anger. Brows furrow, fists clench, adrenaline spikes, tension thickens. Either your heartbeat is accelerating or time is decelerating and your brain’s projectionist is overcranking your thoughts so that you can feel each frame of life as it occurs. There are too many variables to track. A few aggressives are closing in on the circle’s center while others hold their position, poised for anything. Next thing you know, penises come bounding out, vaginas unfurl, naked bodies worm around in a seizing respiring heap, headlights from all angles bleach the passionate tumble to abstraction, watery moans of ecstasy refract off flesh, the smell of secretions perfumes the air, pubic hair flurries up like snow. As much as you’d like to join in, your sexual inhibition (you basically missed every stage of normal sexual development, whoops!) and pre-ruptured anus nag at you to be on your way. Throw your car in reverse: you’ll have to reroute — take Santa Monica to Wilshire to Beverly Glenn and that’ll get you to Mulholland.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vultures and men disguised as vultures perch shoulder-to-wing on the telephone line that runs along Wilshire. Sparks pour continuously from street lights onto Beverly Glenn like tears (or vomit). You make it safely through the East Bel Air Gate; unfortunately, the you of an alternate timeline gets swallowed up by a fissure in the Sunset blacktop and is abandoned by history, never to be thought about again.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ascend up the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains and into the sheet of anthropogenic smog that spills over LA’s lower atmosphere. This smothering haze divests sound and light of all clarity. Let traffic’s current carry you from one color gradient to the next while unearthly pitches flutter around you — the siren song of a thousand lonely suicides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, you’ve arrived home. Your garage-door-clicker-thing seems to be malfunctioning so you park your car on the street overlooking the chromatic aberrations of the San Fernando Valley. Your keys won’t fit in the lock either, and, as you trudge around back to smash a window, you don’t recognize any of the furniture you glimpse inside. A gasp from above: a beautiful blond stranger is gazing at you from your bedroom window, her expression inscrutable, her cheekbones level with her eyes. She disappears and reappears at your rear door, swinging it open to let you in.&nbsp; “Oh my gosh, Haskell, my love, I was so worried you wouldn’t make it back,” her pouty lips quaver, eyes filling with tears. Once you’re inside, she bolts the door, frantically nails wooden boards into the doorframe. “I can’t believe what’s happening. Surely you’ve heard the news?” She seems nice, but there’s no time to reciprocate the tight hug she’s giving you or to quote Airplane! — your gastrointestinal distress demands attention. You shove past her, sprinting up and down the narrow corridors of your house, sliding back the secret bookcases, crawling through the hidden passageways, trying to remember which tunnel leads to the toilet. After much trial and error, you eventually dive down the right chute and wind up in a palatial bathroom stall.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t bother aligning your rear with the toilet — there isn’t time. Just perch at a slight angle, spread them cheeks, and let spray the hot fluid apocalypse, cold water sploshing back atcha. Poseidon must be squirming through these pipes, laughing at you pathetically hunched over the toilet, blood vessels bursting in your eyes and brain. Welp, stink’s entered your nostrils and GFCMS-stink is the olfactory equivalent of staring into the sun. Looks like you’re sense-of-smell’s gone again. It won’t be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowels vacant, now’s the part you look forward to: getting to see whatever nonsense your body produced. Turn around and take it in, for science and your own infantile curiosity. The steam clears to reveal discrete threads of insoluble ink-black ooze floating in the blood-stained water. It doesn’t take long for the waves to subside and the ooze to settle into a final configuration: a sequence of letter-ish shapes that read:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WhereareyougoingyouaskthehomelessmanwanderingdownSanVicenteDontyouknowtheTacoBellis<em>that</em>wayYouenterTacoBellthroughthediscardedsodacupandcheesyvomitgarden…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This goes on for a while, but you’re already bored and the whole diarrhetic-arrangement seems way too long and pleonastic for any reasonable person to finish (like, you get that it’s supposed to be long, or only works if it’s long, but it’s still&nbsp;<em>toooooo</em>&nbsp;long). So you flush. Wipe and flush. And wipe.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the groan of your last flush fades, you can, for a moment, pick up on a distant polyphonic arrangement coming through the silence. An evening drunk screaming himself awake and then back to sleep, a chef sneezing Ebola into an open quesadilla and then closing it, the sound of dripping in reverse: the music of&nbsp;Taco&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;carried by the wind, it sings for the entire city.</p>

<p>Dearest R,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one cycle of the moon has since passed from the time I last lay my eyes upon your visage, yet my heart’s embers burn colder each moment we continue to live apart. Dare I say, I fear their glow could soon extinguish, lest we soon stare into the depths of each other’s soul ‘gain. Their fire could nary be rekindled by the heat, the light, of all the collective incendiaries fallen ‘pon Europe in these tumultuous times. However, their fire could most certainly be rekindled by a much more powerful incendiary, which, as I am presently writing, Szilárd rudely reminds me is the main purpose of my writing this letter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, what of bombs and wars can concern lovers? Does not the flower of a Spring’s meadow capture the soul’s eye swifter than the sword? <strong>(Some scribbles</strong>) Hi President Roosevelt, Szilárd here. Listen, comparing this weapon— that we know the Nazis are currently developing— to “a sword” is like comparing a puddle to the Pacific Ocean of puddles- that really big puddle I once saw in the lot of Long Island City’s 711– nevermind that. What I mean is, whereas a sword could kill maybe 100 people in a day, this nuclear reaction bomb could wipe out hundreds of thousands of people in the flash of an ey...<strong>(more scriblles)</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beautiful beautiful R, if perchance ye believed it in your heart that my voicing of my love for you could be subdued by Szilárd’s wrestling away of the pen fromst my hand, then surest thou had forgotten ‘bout the piano wire I always keep in my coat pocket. No more does the Serious Man restrain our passionate love. No more shall he stand in the way of our destiny. We are lovers and no amount of graphite lined uranium-235 could split us apart, figuratively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forget all the past follies of Szilárd. Forget all talk of Nazis and physics. Remember only our night in Paris... and the love we still share.</p>

1332,"My First Real Piece Ever","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is not a real piece, just my observation about pieces, and I am a human writing this, a perfectly normal human.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, pieces start out with a catchy sentence followed by a quick subversion, which is why I’m telling you that I’m not actually a human writing this, but a giant lizard with a porn addiction. Ha, just kidding! But you totally bought it. You should’ve seen the look on your face, you giant loser. Jokes like that kill ‘em every time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You then question to yourself: what, did that make sense, and did I actually laugh? To which a resounding ensemble tells you: yes, that was funny, and you must indeed laugh. Nevertheless, the plot then continues as is, accepting the reality of what you just wrote as fact even though it makes no sense. For example, if I were to be a giant lizard writing this, I would tell you that no amount of lizard therapy has helped my porn addiction, but, again, I am not a lizard, just a person, writing this piece, which, as I have mentioned, is my first piece ever. Well, my first real piece ever. I digress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meat of the story then picks up and you really start to see the clear joke of the tale-- the larger joke, if you will, embedded with smaller jokes, such as: <em>The only thing worse than this piece is my porn addiction.</em> But, again, no porn addiction here, nor am I a lizard-- just a person, who watches porn as much as the next person. Hence, no addiction, and, again, I am a person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then the piece starts to wrap up, and you can see where it is going; a nice finalé, if you will, of the piece. Maybe a joke or two to really bring you some more emotions, but I’m not here to tell jokes, I’m here to tell you how pieces normally go. If this were a piece, I’d reference back to, I don’t know, my porn addiction, and how I’m a giant lizard living with said porn addiction. But both are lies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then it ends with a one-liner subversion, usually something that you expected but didn’t expect at the same time. I don’t have one of those to give you, though, as this is not a real piece, and I am just a human, not a lizard, with no porn addiction whatsoever.</p>

<p>Wendy Perkins is the hottest girl in the 7<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She reads at a 6<sup>th</sup> grade level, but her body is at a 9th grade level. She wears her mom’s makeup, her sister’s bras, and her daddy’s suspenders to school every day. She smokes cigarettes in the girls’ room to stay thin and vapes VS body spray in the boys’ room as a feminist statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the other girls spread rumours about her. Partly because they’re jealous that Justice pays her to shoplift there and partly because she’s aggressively pro-Israel. I spread rumors about her in the hopes that she’ll hear and ask me to stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She doesn’t even have to sleep with the teachers to get straight A’s. She just walks in, bats her eyelashes, and proceeds to pay attention during class and study really hard at home. I have to sleep with the teachers for them to learn my name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week she told Tim Taylor that she liked his shirt and he drove his mom’s Suburban into their house. The week before that she dropped a weight on Mark Holdren’s foot and he kept the toe even though they could’ve reattached it. I hurt myself in front of a webcam so I can wire her $800 every Sunday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday we had a field trip where everyone just stared at her from behind a velvet rope for six hours. Half the parents wouldn’t sign permission slips because so many kids got heatstroke last time. The other half came as chaperones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s my dream girl, but who am I kidding, a girl like Wendy Perkins would never go for a guy like me. She’s beautiful, smart, cool, and I’m just a boring old gym teacher.</p>

1388,"Fat Camp","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My parents said they knew I could lose the weight on my own, but it’d be so much easier for them not to have to look at me all summer. I expected fat camp to just be a bunch of fat kids, but it was actually just six fat kids and one <em>really</em> fat kid who bullied us for being fat. I remember we once took a canoe out into the middle of the lake and it sank, because we were so fat that we drilled holes in it out of anger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, we would get on the bus and take a field trip from our cabins (a two minute walk from the lake) to the lake. Lazy, perhaps, but we hated walking because we each had siblings die in wars, where they walk a lot. The lake was awesome, but we hated our rivals across the lake, the rich kids at “overweight” camp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My summer love was named Mandy, and she was the most beautiful person I had ever met at fat camp that summer. She and I would lay on the grass all night, just looking at the stars and pondering whether we would be able to get back up from the laying-down position. One time we tried to have sex, but we got caught by a religious counselor who said “Ewww don’t do that I’m religious!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As visiting day approached, we worried our parents wouldn’t recognize us because we had lost such a significant amount of love for them. My parents used to ask if I “felt more comfortable in my body” which made me cry because it reminded me of how limited I was by my physical body in this mortal plane. After my parents left I just kept doing my thing, being fat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though it was sad to leave at the end of the summer, the camp director always said her reassuring catchphrase, “Don’t forget to get fat again for next summer!” We all laughed, and it kept a smile on our faces as our parents drove us back home to fat school.</p>

1422,"History Class","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You always remember where you were when you found out in history class that Abraham Lincoln was shot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The news devastated me pretty good. We'd been studying Lincoln for a few days, and I really took a liking to him. I know some people say Lincoln was weird and tall, but I happened to respect the guy despite all that. So when Ms. Willoughby told me what happened to my hero, I felt absolutely sick, like Abraham did when he was dying of bullet. “Ms. Willoughby,” I said to Ms. Willoughby, “this is just no good.” Sometimes you have to speak up, whether or not it's popular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That night, I went to break the news to my parents. My dad cried and said he had spent years trying to forget. My mom comforted my dad and said forgiveness is good, but John Wilkes Booth will never be welcome in this house. One the one hand, I was proud my parents were willing to take a stand. But on the other hand, I wasn't in the mood for pride— not while “Honest” Abraham Lincoln lay dead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've come to terms with Abe’s death, though I still can't say I support it. Seems to me like John Wilkes Booth should have spent less time killing the president and more time recycling, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a happy ending, though. Remember Ms. Willoughby from the story? Well maybe you know her by her married name: Hannah Schafer. You know, it occurs to me that if you're not from my town, you might not know her.</p>

<p>Dear Judging Committee for the American Society for Magazine Editors,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I notice you have not been receiving my letters. I can not emphasize enough how much I respect your work, despite the fact that my letters were all addressed to a fictional individual whom I created with the intent of confusing your mailman such that he simply delivers your award to 44 Bow St to avoid finding the home of “Emoji Jones.” Without your magazine awards, we would not know what magazine is good. And for that, I am grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I see that the most recent winner of your Ellie, which seems to be the Oscars of written fiction in periodically printed publications, was The Paris Review for “Under the Ackee Tree,” by Jonathan Escoffery. I’m gonna be honest, I checked it out, and I would really direct you to “Adelbert” by HLD ‘18, which is provably from where Jonathan ripped his little story. Sorry, I let my emotions get the best of me sometimes. I harbor no resentment. In fact, I’ve sent you (Mark Schoofs, Editor-in-Chief of Buzzfeed, head of the Ellies committee) this magazine to your personal address (510 Gordon St, Encino, CA 91316) as a gesture of peace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The truth is that I am heartbroken that the Lampoon’s quality has never been validated with an award. In fact, the majority of recent press we have gotten has not been validating at all. That is why I have created this entire issue for your consideration. That’s right, only one copy of this issue exists, and it’s in your hands, Mark.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All I can hope is that you will see in the Lampoon what the Oscars see&nbsp;in white people. I want you to flip through this magazine, personally curated for the American Society for Magazine Editors and the things they like to do / talk about (awards), and I want you to say: “Wow JLG. This thing is full of anthrax. Why did you do that?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s pretty much all I have to say, Mark. And, in the unlikely event of a freak clerical error which results in this issue being distributed to our entire readerbase, I will leave our 750,000 paying subscribers with one piece of advice: whatever it is that you want to do with your life, whatever you’re afraid of, whatever’s holding you back — never tell yourself it’s because you’re not good enough, not talented enough, not intelligent, not beautiful or important — it’s because you don’t have an award like I soon will.&nbsp;</p>

1449,Blockbuster,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The year is 2004. It’s Friday in 2004. You head to the Blockbuster in 2004 with your dad to rent a movie. You’re near the candy and Dad is over by the X-rated movies. He’s going to pick&nbsp;something out for him and Wendy to watch after you go to bed. Life is good. It’s not great, but it’s good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, you hear Dad crumple to the ground. He’s seizing up. “My arm! My arm!” He says, as if crying about it is going to help. You put your fingers to his forehead. He’s bone cold. “Dad? Dad? Dad?” You’re shaking him to make sure you’ve got the right dad. He‘s dead, but it‘s no time to mourn. It‘s time to save face.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alright everyone in Blockbuster, this is a hold-up!” You shout, grabbing your Dad’s gun from his ankle holster (he was an air marshall who had been suspended for applauding too loudly during an in-flight movie). Waving the gun, you move the customers to the back of the store. You ask for a shopping cart and Lyle, the store clerk and a real people pleaser, is the first to defect to your cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You want the Red Vines? Take the Red Vines,” Lyle says, making you feel… making you feel like what you want matters? Like your dad is dead but now you have Lyle and you have these hostages and you have Red Vines, even though you don’t really like Red Vines cause they’re like bootleg Twizzlers but Lyle seems like a real tastemaker so you go with it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah, I’m taking the Red Vines,” you say, putting a handful in your mouth at first but as the hostages start to spaz a little you eat faster and get pretty sick.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lyle, always the consistent accomplice, steps in: “If you need to vom, just go out back. I can take care of things here.” He lines up the customers one-by-one and explains to them how Blockbuster‘s 4 movies for $3 business model is technically profitable, buying you time to go out to the dumpster to throw up. You think about how Lyle is the real hero today, not you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you spew entirely unchewed Red Vines into the dumpster outside of the Blockbuster in 2004 you see the garbage can is filled to the brim with unopened DVD copies of Marmaduke. What the fuck? That movie doesn’t come out for six more years. You go back inside to tell Lyle there’s a gold mine of unreleased dog comedy waiting out there and you’ll cut him in for half. But when you go to tap your dead father’s gun on the window of the Blockbuster what happens? The door is locked. Blockbuster has gone out of business. Permanently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I brew my morning coffee and catch up on the news — just drone strikes and coups. Not really my speed, if you know what I mean. I get in the car: a couple lefts, a couple rights, a couple k-turns, u-turns — I mean, who the hell even knows what they’re doing nowadays, am I right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>NPR’s playing a special on Donald Trump. God, what an absolute hack job that guy is. He just gets me so worked up. But I can’t stay frustrated; I’ve got another long day playing Santa Claus at the Freehold County Mall ahead of me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I pull into my reserved parking spot just 100 yards out from the main entrance. Pretty sweet perk if you ask me. 15% off the kiosks, too.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really can’t overemphasize how massive this kid is. 6 foot 5, maybe 6 foot 6, muscles up the wazoo. You’re probably thinking of a pretty bulky twelve-year-old right now, but I want you to imagine someone three times his weight and four times as muscular, and this kid would still beat the living shit outta whoever you’re thinking of. I’m serious. He looked like he went to the gym three times a day to eat every patron there.</p>

I wince, but I keep a poker face; that’s just life as a professional.</p>

1464,"TV Salesman","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bread the TV Salesman started the day like any other: with a hot cup of coffee and a curse to his mother for being too short. He strolled into the store, Tommy’s Shop ‘n Save TVs, a quarter past 9 with a hankering to make some sales and an even bigger hankering for his favorite snack, buttered toast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On that day the first customer that came in was a dog. No, not a dog of a man, but a real dog kind of dog. He sauntered on in and asked to buy a TV. Bread wasn’t fazed; this happened at least once a week. He reached into his desk, looking smug, and pulled out his trusty “TVs are NOT for dogs” sign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bread watched, his know-it-all smile slowly melting away as the dog continued to look unphased. He turned the sign towards himself and beheld in horror that the “NOT” was crossed out. As it turned out, TVs were for dogs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is this moment that his acquaintances typically point toward as the outset of Bread’s insanity. Indeed, his mental decline was immediately apparent to all coworkers and family members – and all who met him afterwards readily attest to the horrific, inhumane aspect of his gaze and frequent propensity for low, dark mutterings and violent outbursts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This case having been brought to our attention by Bread’s now estranged sister, our medical committee began a full-on investigation into the former salesman. It was our finding generally that the dog incident instigated such a dramatic shift in Bread’s worldview as to render all faculties totally and irreversibly altered. We cannot confirm the nature of his rumored wild nightly experiments in the attic of his old house, but we can attest to their frequently cited production of otherworldly voices and the foetid odor which has ignited such unrest and unease in the neighboring community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But our report must invariably come to events of the 25th of May, the culmination of our dealings with that insane man – if man he truly was. We entered through the unlocked front door at 4:15 in the evening, calling out but to no response. Hearing a commotion in the kitchen, we ran up the two flights of stairs with a nervous excitement to find Bread in the most horrific state of affairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To this day I do not know if what I saw was the truth or some twisted machination of that mad sorcerer. All I can write is what appeared to me that fateful afternoon and hope that it conveys some semblance of reality. For we rounded the corner and discovered Bread making the toast snack which so propped up his previous lifestyle – only instead of buttering the toast he was buttering the front of his own body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon espying our party, the raving mad man let out a shriek such that has never before and should never hence be heard by human ears. Our stunned reaction allowed the daemon a brief window of opportunity for his escape; this expression being especially pertinent as he made a mad dash towards and ultimately jumped through the then-closed kitchen window. Most aspects of this unsettling character remain a mystery following his death, but if anything, I can further attest to the fact that bread always falls butter-side down. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

1478,"My Piece About What It Would Be Like If I Wrote A Piece for the FYC #","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>– What started out as a frankly disgusting case of unbelievable obesity had snowballed into a horrible carnival of flesh and fat––declared a historical landmark some thirty years ago––named Jake Gilbert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ever since the reanimated corpse of Ronald Reagan had recovered from having his Alzheimer’s cured and decided to run for what he thought was a second presidential term, electricity had been strictly forbidden. The Gipper––terrified of electricity because it reminded him that he was scared of electricity––had decreed that the clean-burning cholesterol produced by Jake’s engorged glands was to become the nation’s only source of nighttime illumination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the intervening years, Reagan’s Alzheimer’s had progressed and his intelligence briefings had mostly become reminders of the slight fluctuations in the attractiveness of the Joint Chiefs, his major achievements (being a Hollywood actor, being a former Hollywood actor, personally starting the AIDS crisis by participating in a blood drive, etc.), and how the city was powered (the soft cream cheese lining the guts of minor topographical feature Jake Gilbert). And, in his infinite dementia, President Reagan decreed that Jake Gilbert was to be awarded the first edible Medal of Honor for bravely weighing what no man’s weighed before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only space large enough to fit enough of one of Jake’s limbs to pin a medal on him was the Lincoln Memorial Memorial Theater, built where the Lincoln Memorial had stood before it was tragically destroyed to make room for a theater. Designed to house the wild crowds that came to see the beloved improv troupe T.L. Acronym get shot at by Navy Seals every time they failed to “yes, and” while doing a realistic Irish jig, it was the city’s largest arts and recreation space––if you don’t count Congress (ha ha). Or was it?</p>

<p>Most people don’t believe this, but my job wasn’t always swindling terminally-ill people into buying terminal-illness-curing licorice pipettes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flash-back to the good old days about two or three days ago, and I‘m basically sitting around with my cat, Mittens, and eating licorice non-stop (since that‘s the only thing that makes me any income, by helping me detach from the fact that I write lyrical poetry). Everything changes the day I have a tragic overdose in Dylan’s Candy Bar and develop severe allergies. Goodbye Mittens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Am hungry. Anything helps,” I write to the publishing house as my last desperate attempt at a haiku. Dylan “Candy Bar” Guy, town mobster, intercepts the cardboard haiku just as I had planned. “I‘m gonna make you an offer you can‘t refuse,“ he seductively whispers into my ear as he hands me heaps upon heaps of licorice pipettes. I accept immediately. No fool ever lived to see another day after refusing pipettes from the Candy Bar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is selling licorice pipettes to the terminally-ill really fulfilling? Let’s just say eating them was more fulfilling, but I got yelled at after taking my first bite of a cancer arm.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Flash-forward to the not good old days, now, where I, having just forgotten that I am bathing in water, not licorice cream, took a big sip. Infection had already begun to wither me out when one of the terminally-ill men I‘ve swindled comes to my house and tries to force my pipettes down my throat, asking how does it taste now.&nbsp;</p>

1517,"Half Day","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good afternoon, parents. Principal Mueller here calling to inform you that your student has been released from classes for the rest of today.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I realize that half days are usually reserved for major events like Yom Kippur, Scott Bennett’s dad’s funeral, both, or when Timothy Jernigan is glued to the roof of the gym, but you’ll never guess what happened: Timmy Jernigan was glued to the gym roof again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may feel like an inconvenience to you, but know it is an even bigger inconvenience to us: we can’t remember how we got him down last time and he’s starting come loose from his hold. While my concern for his health is present, so is my interest in how he’ll fare in the free-fall. The physics department has a running bet with the janitorial staff that they’ll be able to clean up the mess in under thirty minutes and the biology department eagerly anticipates the dissection. We don’t want him to fall, but we sure would like to see it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we wait for the boy’s descent an investigation has begun into who could have done this. Jernigan’s primary bullies---Mike Argyle, Mark Sinclair, David Atkinson, Chuck Shooler, Leslie Manhattan, James Teigan Jr., James Teigan Sr., Mrs. Teigan, Doyle Eltonson, Nick Minchin, Mick Ninchin, Ninchin McChinmicknin, Steve Robinson(?), the breakfast club, the varsity hockey team, the varsity baseball team, the varsity football team, the varsity football, Mayor Hoskins, the 1980 U.S Olympic ski team, the breakfast crew, Ted Danson from CSI, Handlebar the Hooligan, the Westborough Street Gang, the Eastborough Street Gang, the Northborough Street Tween Coalition, the streets, the School Board, the Superintendent’s office, crossing guard Mario, Wheelchair Carry, No-Wheelchair Kyle, Walks-Just-Fine Randall, The Burleson County Student Magician Collective, The Chess Society, The Math Team, The Calculator Club, the admins of the webpage <em>www.kidsstucktothings.com/timmyjernigan</em>, the lunch ladies, the “student formerly known as Steve Robinson,” Scott Bennett’s dad, the student protest movement known as “The Fringe,” Spike the Janitor, Anonymous, James Murphy, Blake McCormick: former showrunner of the TBS sitcom Cougar Town, the police, the kids Timmy refers to as his “boys,” Coach Maverick, Coach Leslie, Coach Gomer, Steve Robinson, his direct and extended family, and myself---have all been questioned in relation to the prank, but no evidence has come forth.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to clarify, that while I have<strong> </strong>been known to post Timmy’s diary entries to the lunchroom bulletin, my past victimization of the kid in no way affects my investigation into this incident. Have a good afternoon.</p>

<p><em>Marco Polo travelled the world trading spices, documenting his experiences.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, I entered the city of Kashgar. Rumors preceded the fantastic spice shops that littered the streets, and my taste buds danced in anticipation. What new mysteries might my tongue uncover? Without hesitation, I approached a vendor. He handed me a small jar, and I removed a flake and placed it in my mouth. “Yucky spicy,” I said, impressed by what I’d just tasted. “Too hot, ouch! No like,” I remarked. If this is was merely the first stop on my tour of Kashgarian spices, I was in for a marvelous adventure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I proceeded to the next booth, and was handed an interesting green flake. Excitedly, I consumed it. “Ow ow owwww. Milk. Need milk!!! Eww. I miss my mom. I need my mom. I love my dad too but I miss my mom right now.” Unbelievable. Simply exquisite. I never dreamed that I would stumble into spice heaven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there was still one more spice I had to try. The rare Malagashi Pepper. This was the only place in the world I could acquire it. A small, nondescript booth on the outskirts of town gave me what I needed. “Gross. This is so gross.” The vendor looked at me with an inquisitive smile. “It’s not even hot it just tastes like shit.” I was so excited I could scarcely contain it. “My cousin is a garbage truck man with long hair. Do you play Yu-Gi-Oh? I have a cell phone.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While my stay in Kashgar was pleasant, it is time to move on. Still ahead is Lanzhou, and many more cities before I lay my weary head to rest.</p>

1523,"St. Louis Children's Theatre Production Company","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hello kids, thanks for coming out to audition. First, a little bit about me. My unrelenting passion for children’s theater began when I was cast in the double-role of both Dorothy and the Tin Man in my synagogue’s youth theater production of <em>The Dorothy and Tin Man of Oz, The Timeless Tale You Know And Love but It’s Just Dorothy and the Tin Man.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I delivered my last line: “There’s no place like home, but I’m from Kansas and I’m also assembled from used car parts,” I clicked my bedazzled slipper three times against the insulation tubes and packets of reflective Capri-Sun pouches duct-taped to my other foot. I was struck by the realization that <em>youth theater was my home.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You see, I grew up in a theatrical family. Theater runs in my blood, like sickle-cell anemia, and shards of insulation tube, and other people’s blood, which reminds me how truly touched I am to see you all are here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was a playwright best known for the “fictional” musical: <em>The Dorothy and Tin Man of Oz, The Timeless Tale You Know And Love but It’s Just Dorothy and the Tin Man. </em>Perhaps that rings a bell. You may recall how the concept was stolen and made into a clearly-plagiarized major motion picture, <em>Annie Get Your Gun, </em>based on the scene in <em>The Dorothy </em>where Dorothy has a gun.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other memorable scenes include when Dorothy and the Tin Man skip/clank down the yellow brick road, when Dorothy and the Tin Man swim/sink in the Emerald City lake, and when Dorothy and the Tin Man realize that they will die as they lived: solely in the imaginations of myself, my mother, and our audience member.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most challenging scene, logistically, was the one with the flying monkeys. That’s because there were no flying monkeys, because the only characters were Dorothy and the Tin Man. This would have complicated the plot but thankfully the way my mother wrote it there was no plot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another scene I struggled with was the sex scene, which really messed with my head. I’ve been aroused exclusively by steel tubing and electrical wiring, lamp posts, toasters, refrigerators, gates, pennies, tanks, cars, pots and pans, saxophones, dental oh my god yes, dental, oh, god, yes, mm, aaahh dental scrapers- bike frames, pencil sharpeners, guitar strings, industrial castings, and steel wool my entire life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kids, this has been a difficult decision. But I’ve decided to cast myself as the Tin Man and Taylor can be Dorothy. Let’s begin some method acting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh dear, I appear to be lacking a heart.” Ok Taylor, come over here. I’ll hook you up to the microphone pack and the intravenous blood draw.</p>

1525,"The Beat Generation","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazz flowed from the streets in the 50s. We swam naked in the churches. We prayed in the oceans. We stood around asking when Kerouac would finish that second novel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People stole everything they owned and had everything they owned stolen from them. All anyone owned was a pair of lightly-threaded cutoffs that everyone refused to wear, so our swap-based economy became a public standoff. No one got anything and everyone was cold.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes Kerouac would publish an opening paragraph and redact it the next week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allen Ginsberg was blacklisted from the south side of Brooklyn for wearing a cardigan. John Lennon tried to strangle Neal Cassady for wearing cloth earrings. Elvis died. We knew there were underground literary salons happening we just didn’t know why or when.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jazz took over the culture in the 50s. While not everyone was named John Coltrane, those who were found immense success because of it. Everywhere you looked there was a famous person named John Coltrane. In hindsight, there may have only been one Coltrane, but he played like a half-dozen, and music will never forgive him for it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually the Beat Generation faded away. Jazz was displaced by the harpsichord and nudity was replaced by taping small rocks over people’s pale parts and charging consumption tax on it. While present generations are nostalgic for the past, the Beat Generation was nostalgic for the present. For this, they’ll always be remembered. That and the Korean War.</p>

<p>Mr. Gardener walked right into the gray conference room. He stepped up to the podium, cleared his throat, tapped the microphone, and pied the face of an 8-year-old girl in the front row. Having successfully pied the girl in the face, Mr. Gardener walked back to the podium where he found the 2 pies underneath and sprinted to pie the girl again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Welcome to the Circus Clown Technical Demonstration Conference,” said Mr. Gardener into his hands free microphone. “What I just did is a called a Triple Pie Bozo Slap, and I’ll demonstrate it again on the next person who speaks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gardener picked up his briefcase and calmly walked up to the man. He crouched down to the elderly man’s height and opened the briefcase, demonstrating the 3 pies inside. Mr. Gardener quickly dumped the pies onto the floor and closed the now empty briefcase on the man’s head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Clowns, clowns, clowns. Rule number one: Never do what you tell the audience you are going to do. What I just did is called is called an East Coast Briefcase Punch, and this time I’ll actually demonstrate it on the next person who speaks.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But we are not clowns,” said Brendan, a 9-year-old boy in the second row.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Once again, the East Coast Briefcase Punch.”</p>

<p>“Sir!” said a teacher named Ms. Commons from the back of the room. “We are not circus clowns! You are in the wrong room!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Mr. Gardener climbed over the crowd with his fire extinguisher, got to the back of the room, and emptied the whole can on Ms. Commons, acting as if it was so powerful as to knock him onto the ground for comedic effect.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sit down and shut up!” I yell to myself after shrieking in fear. The kids are in the back being little angels — I hope this is a sleep deprived hallucination and they’re not already dead. I hit the gas and take a two-minute nap.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simon was riding shotgun in Bill Shipley’s car, and his mind was on the party at Alexandra’s house that night. His game plan was to get really fucked up off of mainline heroin and then maybe work up the courage to kiss Rebecca, one of his best friends, on the dance floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Watch your language please Simon,” Mrs. Shipley said from the back seat. “What is he talking about, Bill?”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I think he’s kidding, mom.” Bill said, focusing on the road, trying not to let Simon bother him too much. “I don’t think Simon knows how to buy heroin.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well that’s good,” Mrs. Shipley said. “Simon, you know you shouldn’t even try to buy heroin. It is a very dangerous drug, I hear.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thanks for the tip, Mrs. S!” Simon said, before turning to Bill and slightly lowering his voice. “Yo Simon I’m gonna fuck this burger like I fucked your mom last night!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s enough now, Simon,” Mr. Shipley spoke up from the back seat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yo what the fuck was I thinking, <em>shit</em>!” Simon apologized. “I forgot I was in the car with the <em>king</em> of fucking Mrs. S!” He reached his hand back to high-five Mr. Shipley, and when he was refused he tried to high-five Mrs. Shipley and Mr. Shipley at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Welcome to my zen meditation studio, kemosabe. Now get those clothes off and get on the table, the secrets of the universe wait for no man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Close your eyes and hold your breath, imagine yourself zooming out. Out of your body, out of this building. Stop! Can you see it? If you kinda squint the lake looks like a lady’s bare chest from here. Pretty neat huh? Sometimes those swans float over the middle and look like nipples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now zoom back in. Further. Further. Look! You can see under your own skin.&nbsp; Could you imagine if we all walked around skinless like that? Like hey, wanna shake hands with our raw meat hands and get each other all bloody? We’re so lucky we have skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t have skin. That’s ok though. Keep zooming out. Zoom out until the earth is just a pale blue dot, like the tip of a ball point pen. You should feel the pen rolling over your whole body, making a dotted line at your loins and your trimming points.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zoom out further. Stop! It’s Uranus. What a fun name for a planet. Imagine if I poked your bottom right there as I said that, how funny that’d be. I’d never do that though. The skin is the body’s natural barrier against infection. I lost my skin last Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s just zoom out a little further now. Over there is Orion’s Belt. Look how beautiful, look at the stars. From here don’t they almost spell out “cut along the dotted line”. Remember the pen. Feel the pen against your supple skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And zoom out a little bit further you’ll see a dark nebula, the birthplace of our own sun and thousands more. Feel that rumbling. Like an electric razor shaving your entire body isn’t it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From this distance the earth is a microscopic marble. Skin, no skin. Shaved, bleeding onto the floor. We’re all just little monkeys floating around on some space dust. And don’t those monkeys look like a Skin-Changer 3000? Don’t you want to go in the Skin-Changer with me?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well sorry to break it to you pal, but there’s no such thing as a Skin-Changer. Let alone 3000 such things. But we can dream, my friend. Please keep the lights off when you leave. They hurt my sinews.</p>

1570,"The Big Man on Campus","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday the Big Man on Campus came to class late and the professor apologized. The class cried because they were worried he had missed some of the material. The professor caught a glimpse of his final project as he was walking in. The title was “My Autobiography” and we already knew he would win the best highest prize in this Calculus class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the football game, the Big Man on Campus was proclaimed the star of the team, so he got to sit on top of the Christmas tree for the rest of day. We were all jealous of new-found height, but then we realized he was also very elegant. The crowd cheered loudly when we got the ball back, but they went absolutely crazy when the Big Man on Campus announced the final score. We had come in second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the night of the holiday party, and the Big Man on Campus was scheduled to make an appearance. Unfortunately, he got diabetes, but as he was the man, it was just Type II. We figured out his size and average body temperature, so we left an oven in the middle of the dance floor in his place. Sadly, the building burned down because we forgot to preheat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, he found the answer to a rhetorical question. This was the first time it had ever been done, so, of course, he was written into the history books. During history class when he got to the part about him, he skipped over it to show his humility. We shed a tear because we were all masturbating, and we were into the emotional stuff.In the afternoon, the Big Man on Campus clogged the toilet in the Arts Building, and they renamed the building after him. When he walked out of the newly renamed the Big Building on Campus, Man, everyone applauded. He was <em>the</em> man plus our hands were still sticky from all the jerking off, and we had piano lessons scheduled for later that afternoon.</p>

<p>Her name was Sarah and I was absolutely head over heels for her. I’d cut two holes in a trash can which I’d wear over my body. I’d scoot along behind her in the hallway. When she’d turn around I’d stand totally still. It was pretty embarrassing and I don’t think she knew me as any- thing other than “trash boy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately at the time I developed my crush on Sarah I was also reading about the power of positive thinking, law of attraction, thoughts becoming things that sort of stuff. At home after school I’d write down on a piece of paper: “Sarah will love me back, Sarah will love me back.” I’d do this hundreds of times, only stopping when I needed to jack off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At some point a bit of sperm must have landed on the stack of papers, activating a positive thinking spell because this breeze started blowing through my room and the lights started flickering. Then everything went black. When I came to my parents were standing over me praying. Hundred of these papers with “Sarah will love me back” were strewn all over the room and jizz was everywhere and my parents pulled me out of that school for Sarah’s safety.</p>

<p>I milk myself nightly into my tub. My nightly emissions pool in my bath, glistening with a spectral opalescent shimmer. A month or so into the process, I dip my toe in the tub: the semen is room temperature. I step in, and before I know it, I’m ankle-deep in cumsludge. Perfect. </p>

<p>I take my favorite suit off its hanger and place it gently on the puddle of nut. I step on the suit and hear the wet squelch of jism underfoot. Picking up speed, I stamp down on the wool fabric, like I’m making wine, until each fiber is permeated with my seed. Once I’m satisfied, I step out, dry myself off, and turn the lights off in my bathroom. I wait. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a few weeks in the fetid dark, fungi of all sorts begin to sprout on my navy merino double-breasted. I remove the suit from the bath and, careful not to sever any of the mushrooms I have fathered, drape it over my body. Giddy with excitement, I make my way to the offices of Morgan Stanley, where I am to compete with hundreds of aspiring analysts for one of twenty-three job openings in their LatAm banking team. The fabric gurgles wetly as I shake my interviewer’s hand. He looks me up and down a couple of times and flashes a wry smile. </p>

But what kind of name is Brother Eli? No, sir, I can’t answer that question. No, I cannot testify to what happened in Guadalajara. And God no! I’m flattered, but even if I was Brother Eli, I would have no interest in renewing Prima Nocta with your first-born. I don’t care that she’s agreed to it.</p>

Well, uhh, I actually met Brother Eli in Guadalajara. We developed this product, the Toilet Net, to- gether. No, it was not to catch gold pellets out of his intesti...? Did he tell you he shat gold nuggets? No, it’s just, uhh, he seemed embarrassed about it when he was with me. Anyway, are you interested? Oh, Brother Eli controls your finances? I’ll come back with him then.</p>

<p><strong>Apt 4L: </strong>Sir, help! Mighty Brother Eli is trapped in Guadalajara. The cartel has kidnapped him and seeks to use his digestive system as a human gold production factory. I am his associate, and I am raising money to fund his escape. Because of tax purposes, we are funneling the money through a holding company called Toilet Net. Please consider buying... Teleportation powers, you say? Yes, that does solve his problem. I’ll be on my way.</p>

<p><strong>Apt 2E: </strong>Madame! After all these years, we meet again. You don’t recognize me? It is I, Brother Eli. I swapped bodies with a gringo child in Guadalajara, as is within the realm of my established powers. Now I have returned all grown up! I can sense you’ve been keeping yourself chaste for me. But before we dive into that, I have to tell you about a new product I developed on my pilgrimages. It’s absolutely fantastic, and I know it’ll help you too because that wig of yours is liable to just plop in any day... Ma’am! Keep your hands off me. You've waited 34 years.

<p>First, when you get the wrong stuff, kiss Grandma but make sure she knows she screwed up. Say “Cool, Grandma…”, then go sit alone in your room and don’t take the present with you. If your mom makes you write a note, etiquette says write it like, “Thank you for the present. I hate Mommy. I love you even though.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Missy Manners:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mom makes me have my birthday party with the red-headed boy because we have the same birthday. This is not fair!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gentle Reader:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the moms cut the cake and the boy’s mom hands the first piece to you, don’t eat it like it has cooties. Say, like etiquette, “Give it to Dee” and cry when they ask why. When Dee tries to get another piece say “You have had enough.” This is okay, because your mom knows you really hate this boy, but she is being cheap with the other mother, so she feels guilty. Don’t say anything in the car home. Then say, “this is the worst birthday ever”. This will make mom cry.</p>

1849,"De La Comtesse","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>January 31, 1950</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>     Snibbins came into the room and presented me with twenty dollars. He looked apologetic as he explained, “Chesterfields aren’t worth very much this season, and he didn’t like the idea of the patchwork quilts sewn in over the linings. Not a selling point at all, he claimed.” “My God, doesn’t he realize what a patchwork-quilt lining means on a cold wintry night? You shouldn’t have settled for less than thirty, but, we do need the money.” I looked around the room and noticed that all the furniture must have been sold.<br>     Every mail brought ultimatums from haberdashers, the phone company, and the old university itself. Today our Chesterfields had gone; tomorrow it might be the very clothes we were wearing. With the dollar really nothing more than a New Deal disguise for a dime, Snibbins and I had recently come face to face with reality—it was impossible to go through Harvard on $940.72 a year, even if the catalogue did say so.<br>     Snibbins looked particularly sad, tears rolling down his cheeks, staining his regimental tie, dripping down over his tattersall, finally settling in his watch pocket where they raised havoc with his waterproof, shockproof watch. His gray flannels looked conspicuously mussed — these were the dark pair, which I have always called his “Gray Flannels Number One.”<br>     “Dammit,” Snibbins said. “It’s a question of selling apples on the street or pewter beer mugs from door to door.”<br>     “There is a more subtle approach,” I commented. “Go from door to door, explaining that you’re running some sort of questionnaire, and then suddenly pull out an order blank and a list of magazines—with the extra-bonus-point magazines starred with red pencil—and you tell the person that you are working your way through college and that you must get fifty thousand points by July 30, 1953 in order to qualify for a prize of an extra prize of fifteen dollars, a Mickey Mouse wrist watch, and an all-expenses-paid week-end in Binghampton.”<br>     Snibbins answered, “Yes, but I have no sales personality—in fact, I have no personality at all. Besides, there must be an easier way.”<br>     I nodded. “What about some sort of work that we could carry on in the room? Perhaps a veterinary and kennel business.”<br>     “Against the rules.”<br>     “I’ve got a daring idea. We’ll start a smuggling business on illegal French novels, Henry Miller, Frank Harris, and that sort.”<br>     “But what we want is quick money and big money. Thousands,millionsof dollars. We don’t want a job, Snibbins, what we want is an oldfashioned, American style, roottootin’ pay-off.”<br>     “Right.”<br>     “It’s a damn shame those pyramid clubs aren’t still going.”<br>     Snibbins remembered the bottle of Pernod which he had salvaged from our liquor cabinet which had gone out last week, and after a few highball glasses of the stuff, we thought ourselves to be not so downhearted after all—we suddenly discovered all sorts of grand ideas.<br>     And the idea that we finally hit on, well, it was a scheme which makes the A &amp; P look like a fruit stand. The strange thing about it was that it looked just as attractive the following morning. A week later, in the conservative Parisian newspaper of thehaut monde, Le Figaro,an advertisement appeared in the personal section: “Refined, cultured, young, spirited American gentleman desires correspondence with French lady of considerable means. Object is matrimony, with an American marriage certificate. Do not reply unless you want American citizenship with all its benefits and are willing to pay for it.”<br>     A few days later we received a letter which was postmarked from Paris. I remembered Snibbins’ venture, and so I ran directly to him—by this time we had even sold what was left of the Pernod—and told him of our success. “Wealth and power at our doorstep,” I yelled to him. “We should be able to buy back the Bentley next week.” He ripped the letter open, read its contents, and began jumping up and down—at times Snibbins was a rather unstable fellow. He spoke, “Why, it’s from French royalty, the Countess de Pigale, and she sounds really game. She offers us a big kiss behind the ears and three million francs to boot!” This was good news, I said to myself. “Why that’s ten thousand dollars—we’re solvent once again! Listen to this! She says it will be fine if we simply meet her in New York, sign the necessary papers, and then send her off to Reno for the automatic divorce.”<br>     “Fine,” I said. “Now there’s a young lady who knows when she’s well off. Get her over here immediately.”<br>     The sky was blue and the sea was calm when the He de France sailed up the East River and into her berth. It is always a fair day and a calm sea when any modern steamship enters port, not to be confused with the rough, stormy seas which one finds when reading about the grand old days of clipper ships and fine old British gentlemen traveling to Australia to replenish their fortunes and pay their respects to Lord Poppitsford, the Governor-General.<br>     After a few toots of the ship’s whistle and one prolonged blast of the ship’s horn, which discharged a threatening tremolo, the gangplank was lowered, the Captain stared down from the bridge, the crowds cheered as they saw their friends, and the ship’s parrot commented,“Les Americains,quels foux!”<br>     The Countess ran swiftly down the gangplank, embraced us tenderly as only a French countess can do, shoved the three million francs into Snibbins’ hand, whispered,“Je t’aime, je t’aime, and finally asked, “Are you the young men who are to meet the Countess de Pigale?”<br>     We rushed the Countess to a small uptown cafe called Au Cheval Pie, which always reeked with French atmosphere, with a Edith Piaf-ish chanteuse repeating the Marseillaise over and over again, with waitresses who would always whisper, “Allo, bebe,” in your ears, and the tip, of course, conveniently figured into your bill.<br>     This remembrance of gay Paris should be enjoyable to our Countess, so we thought, and she made herself very comfortable in a cane-backed chair. After unloading a cigaret vending machine into her purse, she ordered an ale and a dish of pretzels. Our Countess had turned out to a different sort of person than what we expected.<br>     That evening we went to every place with a French name in town: Au Cordon Bleu, Cafe de Paris, Cafe de la Paix, Chez Pierre, Chez Mao Tse-Tsung. Going to the hotel in the early morning, the Countess, who was sitting up straight in the Skyview Taxi, suddenly turned to us and commented, “I sure as hell wished you guys had taken me to some American joints tonight. What about going to them in Reno, Snibbie?” she asked.<br>     By this time, she had persuaded Snibbins to go to Reno with her. He did not need much persuasion, for he wanted to end any marriage with our Countess as soon as possible and with all certainty. In the afternoon, I said good-bye to them at La Guardia Field, and Snibbins also gave me my half, five thousand dollars.<br>     I hastened back to school, got the Bentley out of hock, bought a case of Pernod for Snibbins return, and refurnished the rooms in standard Victorian. When I opened the mail box, dozens of letters from France slipped out. I put them in a little pile on Snibbins’ desk and considered Vaffaire d’amour a fait accompli.By this time, the days were going by very quickly, days turned into months, months into years, years back into months. The Pernod looked rather good, and, as any roommate of Snibbins would have done, I decided to try the new batch out. Good old Snibbins, I kept saying to myself, bottle after bottle. I fell asleep, and dreamed that I was a French Count in the court of Louis XIV, who resembled Snibbins quite a bit. I had a strange sensation of being beheaded, which is not a comforting feeling at all. I felt confused and was awakened by a noise at the door.<br>     I opened it, and noticed a telegram and the morning paper. All it said was, “HOPE YOU ARE STILL A FRIEND AND WILL PLAY ALONG.” What could this mean, I asked myself innocently? Perhaps old Snibbins is playing some game. Then I noticed the newspaper. The headlines explained the telegram, “HARVARD STUDENT DIVORCES COUNTESS,” they screamed. “NAMES ROOMMATE AS CO-RESPONDENT.”</p>

1852,"Sky Diving","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s up, my name’s Trad, and I’ll be your skydiving instructor this afternoon. Now I know some of you may be scared, but you honestly have nothing to worry about. When you’re in the plane, you’ll have me – a very strong and powerful man – tightly strapped to your back, controlling your body, and inching you step by step towards emptiness. Cool, breezy emptiness. And when you’re in freefall, you’ll be comforted, as my lips caress your earlobe and softly whisper, “This is flying.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I’ve got some strict rules. First, I never dive with a woman, not because it makes me uncomfortable, but because I fear that her breasts may attract condors. Second, I never dive strapped to a short person. The last time I tried that, his feet couldn’t touch the ground when we landed, and to this day he still thinks he’s plummeting. Third, you have to close your eyes when we fall through a cloud so as not to intrude on angels. Cool? So if you two women and you, short guy, could just hang out…feel free to grab a Dew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listen, you’re all doing something great today. You’re entering into skydiving history, from that first guy who looked at the sky and declared, “That is something I want to be falling through,” to the guy who saw the first airplane take flight and declared, “It’s about time.” Maybe you’ll be that first skydiver to realize that the parachute is just a crutch and that you can fly all on your own like Dumbo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I would like to clear up the common misconception that it is somehow challenging to do flips and similar stunts while in the air. It’s not. When you’re surrounded by nothing but air for minutes, you can do as many flips as you want.</p>

1859,"Advice from a Car Thief","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless you know exactly what you’re doing, stealing a car can prove difficult and confusing. &nbsp;Here are a few guidelines to keep your head calm and your car stolen, presuming you now own someone else’s car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t steal cars from your own block and definitely don’t steal cars your own driveway. &nbsp;As a rule of thumb, don’t steal anything from your own driveway–it’s against the law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, but never wear gloves with suction cups attached, unless the car is parked on the side of a building or on the side of another, more levitating car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you steal the car, don’t speed away with the tires screeching. &nbsp;You’ll only draw attention to yourself. &nbsp;Instead, remove the tires and walk the car home gently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A great idea is to switch the stolen car’s license plates with novelty plates that say “Mine 4 Real.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Get your hands on a police radio. &nbsp;That way, when the cops are giving chase, you can trick them by pretending to be a policeman and saying, “I’ll take it from here, pigs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Might I suggest reverse psychology? &nbsp;Stereotypical thieves wear all-black outfits and sneak around at night. &nbsp;I staple Christmas lights to a neon-orange shirt and yell profanities while stealing fancy cars in broad daylight. &nbsp;Who would ever suspect I was a real thief? &nbsp;Apparently, several eyewitnesses, the police, a federal judge and a jury of my peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create a diversion like the sound of a wind of a sound-wind sounding a wind sounding SOUNDING WIND! (I just stole your car.)</p>

1861,"Gag Gifts","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People love getting gag gifts—but what gag to give? This simple guide to gag gifts is the perfect gag gift for anyone who enjoys giving gag gifts without any outside guidance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For a person who hates gag gifts</strong>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one’s too obvious—a gag gift! It works on two levels. This gag gift will be a jar of jellybeans that says “Sex Pills.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For a standup comedian:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This guy makes a living off gags (and talking about gags), so a gag gift would just be something he could use professionally. Instead, slash his voicebox. A silent comedian is a gag gift for the audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For a prisoner of war:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That jokes! This is the only gift I don’t need!” your friend would surely say about the gag you sent him—if he didn’t already have an identical gag stuck in his mouth!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For a diabetic:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A jar of sex pills. The label says “Jellybeans.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For a prisoner of war contemplating suicide:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Smuggle him a fake gun. When the trigger is pulled, out comes a flag that says “POW!” Not only will you avert the suicide, but you’ll remind him of the state that drove him to attempt it. Gotcha!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For your wife:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Formally revoke last year’s gift (an official-looking piece of paper that says “License To Be a Bitch.”) My mistake, honey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For Dale Kupersmith inventor of Viagra, the so-called “sex pill”:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A pen that gives you an electric shock. This is the ultimate gag gift.</p>

1863,"My Unhappy Rendezvous with Magical Realism","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My travel agent suggested that I spend my paid vacation this year in a small coastal town in South America. It was the worst vacation ever. A lot of things went wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juanita was our chef for lunch the first day. She had just bid farewell to her lover, posted by the military to a distant port town. Her infinite tears spilled into the flour like raindrops while she cooked, expressing in taste what she was forbidden to tell with words. When she served the meal, each bite echoed with the unbearable sadness of Juanita’s limitless heartbreak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the worst burrito I ever had.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next night I went to the town’s annual talent show.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first act was a young boy who sang, with such beauty that the birds dropped dead from the sky of jealousy (but no one translated the song for me). Then came a melodramatic lady who, with great tears and fanfare, vanished permanently from the earth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally after what seemed like forever, it was time for my magic trick.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Say what?</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quickly switched categories and tried to win for “Most Ironic”—but that award went to some blind prophet who could tell how many fingers a person was about to hold up but never how many he was holding at the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the awards ceremony, first prize turned out to be the undying love of a woman whose excess of sensual passion could melt all the snow of the Andés. I wondered aloud if she also had enough excess of detergent to get me clean towels. “Oh, that was the prize for ‘most Ironic,’” &nbsp;she smirked, with such excess of sarcastic force that the Amazon started to flow backwards, flooding my hotel room and ruining a lot of my stuff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following evening I noticed an attractive lady sitting by herself at the town dance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What’s your name?” I asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have no name,” she whispered through closed lips. “Beauty is nameless,” echoed the wind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can I get you a drink?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that she floated away, off the Earth forever. She was too beautiful for the Earth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Too pretty,” sighed the man to my right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, pretty, I repeated. (Pretty lame.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could anything save my trip? I thought at least I could get some good surfing in the next morning. I hiked down to the beach—but the damn ocean was as still as ice!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In our town,” explained the sage José Revuelto de Cementario, before turning into a spider, “those who stare at the moon by night erase its morning power over the waves.” Or something like that—I wasn’t really listening. “Perhaps you may surf on the sand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, José. That’s&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how surfing works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was time to put an end to this dumb vacation. In the town plaza, I found an old book shop that I figured might sell a guidebook that could help me find a way to leave town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doorknob is loose, I thought as I entered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So, I hear, is the woman who bore thee,” punned the mind-reading gypsy behind the counter, In English, absolutely embarrassing me, as he handed me the guidebook. The store erupted in cold flames as I left, and frankly, I was glad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out the guidebook that the old gypsy had sold to me was not an ordinary guidebook, but an account of my own journey to the town. I skipped ahead a couple pages, and before long found the text predicting my reading of each word of the book as I read it. As I stared into my unfolding fate, present and future became one, my life and my destiny trapped together for eternity in an inescapable and endless hall of mirrors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the most boring infinite stretch of time ever.</p>

1869,"Life o’ the Party","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone knows a Ralph Rummy. You see him at every party, every picnic, every Saturday night at the Bowl-O-Matic. He imbibes a wee more alcohol than he can handle, and then becomes unruly and uncontrollable. He makes lewd remarks, staggers from one garbage can to the next ralphing up his lunch from three weeks hence, and then finally, under the mild protests of his friends, he climbs behind the wheel of an automobile and backs slowly over a small child. After the party’s over, the picnic is packed up and the bowling shoes are back on the rack, everyone comes to the mutual agreement that in the light of day, Ralph Rummy just wasn’t much of a fun drunk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alcoholism. It’s an ugly word; it breaks up families, it destroys careers, it kills. But it also provides a cornucopia of the best live entertainment. Just think how many of the finest, most magical moments of the cinema eminated from the slurred speech of W.C. Fields. Fields: You’re ugly! Woman: (disdainfully) You’re drunk! Fields: Madam, but that may be true, but in the morning, I’ll be sober. Surrounding Crowd: Touché! Touché! What a burn!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even behind the scenes W.C. Fields provided moments of inebriated merriment. Fields: (to bartender) I’d like a whiskey, straight up. Woman: (sitting on a nearby stool) You’re nothing but a fat booze-hound, not fully at all. Fields: Lady, blow me. Chorus of Drunks: Bravissimo! Atta Boy! Our Hero!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many might assess Field’s retort as merely rude, instead of seeing him for the whimsical soak that he is. The distinction, however, is important. It spells the difference between permanent ostracization or an invitation to paradise. Who wants to be around the depressing sort of drunk with a season to pass to Alcoholics Anonymous? Well, nobody. The life of a fun drunk is very different. Many find alcohol to be a great boon. Rather than lose their jobs, they find the invitations to entertain at children’s birthday parties never stop. Or if they’re lucky, they become well-paid game show hosts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The society of daffy dipsomaniacs is not open to any old stumble bum. There are specific rules of etiquette which must be followed if one is to truly adopt the title of “Fundrunk”. Let’s follow Farley Fundrunk through a typical cocktail party to pick up a few pointers, shall we?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As all fun drunks have learned, there is nothing more annoying than arriving at a party, throwing back a good deal of rotgut and then discovering that the host owns none of the accoutrements that really make a party fly. Here we see Farley has come prepared with lampshade, cigars, wacky tie, and a woman’s brassiere in his briefcase, should things get really hot. The guests are relieved he has finally arrived, and are anticipating the excitement to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once inside, Farley finds that he is quite thirsty for liquor-drinks. Since he knows that he is going to visit the bar quite often, he notes the objects in the room which will serve as landmarks to help him make his way once his eyes have clouded and his legs have turned to warm porridge. Farley seems to have marked another path as well which he plans to use during the evening. You might want to do the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh-oh, it looks like Farley has had “one too many.” Nothing ends a party quite like vomit. The less of it, the better. Again, Farley has come prepared. By establishing a certain room in the house as the “Vomitorium” with this smart but simple sign, he has saved his host the anguish of discovering “hidden accidents” a month later in some hidden corner of the house. And what fun! What might have been a disgusting faux pas has been transformed into an ancient Bacchanalian rite!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who’s the life o’ the party? Well, there’s no mistaking here. Once revved up for the evening, Farley Fundrunk capers about, urinating in the pool, going for a spin in the clothes dryer, and biting the head off the canary. The height of the evening is always when a prudish matron suddenly cries, “My pantyhose–it’s gone!” and everyone knows where to find them. Look! Farley’s got DONKEY EARS!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it’s time to go home, but not before thanking the host and hostess for a marvelous bar. Don’t forget, they have a lot to thank you for. After all, if it weren’t for your wild antics, the party might have reverted into a sleep-a-thon. So give them each a great big sloppy lick–hey, you’re drunk! You can do anything and get away with it. Even Lady Law turns her head if you can be witty enough. Try these out on the next police officer who pulls you over for drunk driving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Weaving?!?&nbsp;</em>I was dodging the pink elephants!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I know I was speeding, officer, but my foot felt like fudge and I couldn’t find the accelerator. I mean brake. Oh, I don’t know what I mean. Windshield wipers. What the hell’s the difference–am I right? Am I right?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s not as bad as it could be, officer. I’m so cockeyed right now. I thought I hit two ladies instead of just one.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every party must come to a close. , and unfortunately, it often closes with a hangover… WHAT AM I SAYING?!? The party&nbsp;<em>never&nbsp;</em>stops for the fun drunk. Take one final tip from Farley:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>When making toasts just raise your glass</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>And toss it down the hatch</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>But after ten or twelve of these</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Beware the lighted match!</em></p>

1873,"TV: Harmful or Just Deadly?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How many times have I witnessed parents passing around photos and talking endlessly about their kids?–“My son’s the idiot of his class,” “Mine’s a real palsy. Can’t even walk upright.” “Today my daughter’s teacher called me just to tell me he hates her,” “My kid killed someone last week.” It makes me wonder about what kind of parents they are, especially when they say, “I don’t drink, smoke, or swear. God-dammit, I left my cigarettes at the bar!” Now, how are we supposed to believe them when they lie to us so blatantly, and so ineptly, too?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kids learn from two different sources: their eyes and their ears. Without the one, the other is useless. Yet they are both being ruined by famine, pollution, war, and a lack of attention span. And who do you think is responsible? Our “friend,” the television set.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s about time for our community to wake up and see that T.V. is nothing but a Pandora’s box, with a Pandora’s picture tube inside. Take for instance the unprecedented growth of juvenile violence. How can parents rear their children to be the docile creatures they should be when the evil presence of T.V. lurks in the house? Well, they can’t. Just looking at a television set can give an impressionable child ideas, and sure enough, he soon realizes that it can be used as a weapon, and then throws it at the first person who hurts his feelings, which is usually me. What’s more, it destroys the mind and body of every American child. Kids are very confused when first meeting Mickey Mouse because “television” lures them into believing that the mouse is much smaller. No doubt about it, T.V. is a danger. It is programmed to harm the youth of this great nation. For instance, turning channels is much like dialing too many phone numbers–their small digits cannot handle the stress. Now I wouldn’t let my kids watch a telephone all day, so why would I let them watch T.V.?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the parents of this U.S. of A. would sit down and take a look at T.V., they would realize what is happening to their youngsters. Too many “educational” shows mold our children into the crooks and jerks they are today. Shows like&nbsp;<em>Kill Your Mother, Take All the Money From Your Father’s Wallet,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Please Don’t Learn to Spell</em>&nbsp;cannot help but have a bad influence on our youth, or anyone else’s youth. They also offend me, personally. We all know that too many commercials spoil the broth, and by extension, a child’s mind as well. Kids see maybe a zillion commercials in one night, and then they bug me to buy them&nbsp;<em>everything</em>–Big Wheels, Cheating-Barbies, Biz Bags, and a Hart’s two-in-one flea and tick collar. There ought to be a law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may realize by now that I don’t like television, even though the children do. It hurts them and makes them say really stupid things. My views may be shocking, but at least they’re right! I’m just glad there’s one person (me) who has the courage to say something about it. We can all agree that T.V. sets should be used for bookcases instead, bookcases with spelling books inside. There are too many kids who can’t spell the simplest of words. If you ask them what C-A-T spells they probably will answer “Shut-up.” Everyone knows it actually spells “cat!”</p>

1875,"In the Beef Box","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The name’s Leonard, fella. And believe me, I know hamburger. No, not steers, or fattened heifers or even London broil. Just hamburger. Buster, the stories I could tell you about the hamburger game… well, they’d curdle your cod. I’ll tell you. Really wither your whip. No foolin’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you wonder where I got the straight poop on the burger biz? Well, lemme tell you, ya don’t learn this stuffy second-hand. No sir, you got to–ya wanna know a secret, bub? Yeah, well catch this: I was a choice three ouncer myself not too long ago. Yup, me–a Burger King Whopper. I know, I know I look just like you and the wife there. Believe me, I wouldn’t make up a story like this, Mac. I was a lousy, stinkin’ hamburger once. Store number 4, Lincoln, Nebraska, November 16, last year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cut and pressed and frozen and fried just like all the others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I knew from the beginning I wasn’t the same as those other fuckin’ lumps of meat. I thought. I felt, I–and I don’t mind tellin’ you this–I was horny. But it wasn’t for those sexless hunks of gristle around me that I lusted. Uh-uh. It was those big, warm, tender buns at the end of the line. I knew–we all knew, couldn’t help but know–what happened after the broiler. Grasped, carressed and thrust into a couple of steamy, doughy slabs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other burgers, they did it mechanically, mindlessly. No feeling, no emotion; woofed down by some pimply high schooler in a few short minutes, oblivious to death as they were to life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, I didn’t want it to end there: heat, sizzle, packed, gone. I wanted to take that bun and make a real go of it, ya know? Good times, messin’ around, sure. But I wanted a real relationship, too, you understand. I just knew me and those sesame seed-covered bazombas could stick together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well I wasn’t even supposed to be thinking, ya know, a crummy, Id-less hamburger and all, but I thought about it just the same, and thought hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought about living and the good things and trees and picnics and Jesus: “Think hard enough,” I said to myself, “and you’ll get outta this somehow.” It couldn’t be meant to end here, so quickly, so absolutely. “I got a fuckin’ ego too!” I cried. “I don’t wanna slip away into digestive oblivion like that! I don’t wanna die!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So all of a sudden, I felt like I was goin’ bananas. Outa my skull, crazy, cracked, goo-goo. Everything was flashing and whirling and exploding like, like nothing I ever saw before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then–plooey! I’m out here walkin’ around the streets like you. Thought it was great at first. No more messin’ around with hamburgers; I was real.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But so what am I? A lousy goddamned MacDonald’s branch manager. “Job security, Rapid advancement. Big pay.” Big deal. I hate these icky little hamburgers. Flopping meat around all day, tossing on those greasy chunks of bread. Ordering around pubescent french fry-cookers. You think this is any better than before? Think again, buddy. So I’m “free to do what I want.” Free to do what, for Christ’s sake. Work in a sweaty, smelly burger joint 14 hours a day?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the donation to the Heart Fund that you sent in my honor. I hope you do not mind that I exchanged it for a combrable donation to the Cancer Society.

Or maybe my roommate could use the bird cage cover as a trash can lid cover–I know she’ll need one of those. Whatever the case, I know I’ll have a swell time trying to decide how to use your gift most creatively.</p>

<p><em>Pleasant City, Ohio–In which a reporter for a major news network discovers America, life, and the world around him.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Walter Cronkite: For the past six years, our reporter Charles Kuralt has been traveling around America reporting on what gives true meaning to the lives of people like you. This report will be his last. For in America’s heartland, Charles Kuralt has at last found America’s heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>[Charles Kuralt is shown standing in front of a wooden frame bar with a horseshoe-shaped green neon sign in the window. Red letters proclaim “Ladies Invited.” Through the window comes the glow of a T.V. set over the long wooden bar.]</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charles Kuralt: Interstate 70 and Interstate 77 intersect at Pleasant City, Ohio. Even if they did not, the Horseshoe Bar and Lounge (Ladies Invited) would still be here. We know that. It was here before the interstates were. And time, like the trucks that rumble by here, flows forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>[Camera switches inside. A customer in 16th-century garb is sitting at the bar; the waitress addresses him.]</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barmaid: Hey Bacon, what you having?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: Ahh Hell. How would I know? I just got up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2nd Customer: What’s up, Bacon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: Me. Weren’t you listening?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charles Kuralt: Like the Bacon who didn’t write Shakespeare’s plays?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: I did write Shakespeare’s plays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>[At this moment Bacon’s body is brushed by the boastful Baptist breasts of the Barmaid.]</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barmaid: Excuse me for being so alliterate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: Illiterate?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>[She slaps him.]</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: Bourbon and Coke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: With no ice.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: Make it a double and skip the coke?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barmaid: That’s better. Now let’s try to avoid excessive dialogue in this celluloid mood painting of life in America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charles Kuralt: Earlier this evening an amazing thing happened. On this T.V. set above the bar flickered a re-run of “Peter Pan.” When the time came for the viewers to clap to save Tinkerbell, nobody moved. They stared blankly. In spite of Mary Martin’s begging they simply watched. And Tinkerbell faded away. Nowadays life is seldom as you would expect it. Ten years ago this would have caused a furor. There would have been angry letters to the editor, jammed T.V. station switchboards, marches in New York City, pique in Darien, Connecticut. B. F. Skinner’s pigeons would probably have quit playing ping-pong. The world would be changed. Tonight, no one cared. On the road we have found this–the American Spirit.</p>

<p>Bacon: Somewhere on the left bank of the Seine River, a Parisian artist is watching a hair, dark and thick, growing out of his knuckle.</p>

<p>Barmaid: So what?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2nd Customer: So what?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bacon: It’s sort of the Human Condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barmaid: Or a symptom of it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2nd Customer: Or a metaphor for it?</p>

<p>Charles Kuralt: This is Charles Kuralt, at the end of the road, in Pleasant City, Ohio.</p>

1881,Hold-Up,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>      Although French Calder’s Service Station and Ford Agency was a place everybody in town stopped by from time to time during the day, French himself was often lonely, especially in the dead hour between nine-thirty, when all those going to work had got there, and eleven o’clock, when the earliest lunch hours commenced. Even after nine years of tending station by himself, French still liked company. Some garage men feel at home with cars, but French said he’d rather talk to people any time. People said French should have been a doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So he was glad to see the Nixon boy cross Route 328 and head for the gas station. Young Nixon was walking along the drainage ditch, scuffling his feet and dressed up in good clothes. “Hello, Jim,” French said. “How come you aren’t at work?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Quit,” Jim said, studying his knuckles and picking at one of them with a fingernail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Quit, you say?” French tried to keep his voice down, so the curiosity wouldn’t show.&nbsp;“And here I thought you were having a good time, learning a man’s trade. If I had learned a man’s trade now, I woudn’t be stuck here. My Dad, he always thought things would take care of themselves. ‘All things come to him who waits’, he used to say. So he just let me have my head when I was a youngster.”&nbsp;French paused and smiled. “What’d you quit for?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jim Nixon frowned, his eyebrows seemed to get heavier and hang more over his eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim thought slow. He was heavy in everything he did and always afraid of making a mistake. He never said much for fear of embarrassing himself. “I just quit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French ducked down and picked up an oily rag and rubbed around his hands with it. “Don’t think I can’t understand,” he said. “A young man right out of high school doesn’t care to work himself to death right off. Even a powerful boy like you gets tired. No need to apologize, Jim. I would’ve left this job many a time if my father wasn’t dead and it was either sink or swim with me. ‘Sink or swim’, my Dad said before he died . . .”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I liked the work fine. I’m not afraid of any work.” Jim spoke a little louder than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Must admit I thought you were getting along. Ben Youngers said he thought you were coming along. ‘The boy takes his time’, he said to me just the other day, ‘but what he does he does his best to do right’. He never thought you’d quit on him. But then, I know Ben Youngers, and I know he works his new men hard and wants them to measure up. That’s the way it is in any trade, Jim. They want you to measure up at first. Can’t say truthfully I care for Ben myself personally, but . . .”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim took a step forward and for a second stared French in the eye. “I like Ben fine. I didn’t quit because of Ben or, or anybody.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Then what did you quit for?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Look, French, I can’t stand here talking all day. Let’s go inside.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Sun getting you?” French asked politely. “Now, me, I work inside all day, sometimes until ten, eleven at night, and I’m always grateful for a chance to get outside in the air. But then, as you get older, the sun bothers you less. When I was your age, I wouldn’t’ve liked it either, all day in the hot sun, lugging boards and taking lip off Ben Youngers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “I like the work fine, and Mr. Youngers, too.” Jim touched his coat pocket and glanced toward the road. “I want a candy bar.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“A candy bar! So that’s what you’re after. First time I ever knew you to have a sweet tooth. Doesn’t do your teeth good, you know.” As French walked into the cool of the garage, he noticed how close Jim kept behind him. The candy was kept in a glass case in the corner, beyond the grease pit and beside the rack for the tools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What kind do you want?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Any kind.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Anything? Wish all my customers were as unparticular as you. I could give you some Nibs, except they pull the fillings out of teeth. How about a Milky Way? They’re soft. Half is, anyway.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Anything. An O Henry.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When French handed the O Henry to Jim, he saw Jim had a gun in his hand, an old-fashioned pistol, the kind that shot out of a cylinder, still wet with new oil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim blushed and looked away. “This is a hold-up,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t tell me! A real hold-up? I’ve read about plenty in the papers, but this is the first time I was ever in on one. Want me to stick up mv hands?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Put your hands up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French stretched his hands toward the ceiling and wiggled the fingers a little. “How’s this?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t reach for anything like that air hose overhead.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Jim, that’s shrewd of you. I wouldn’t have thought of that myself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Cut it out. Just give me the money.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why, you know I will. And there must be over three dollars change in the candy case. I’ll give it to you all, not to mention the nickel that candy bar’s worth.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim threw the candy bar on the cement floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I aways knew,” French said, “you weren’t the sort of boy to ruin his teeth on a lot of candy bars. Why, I bet that was just a whateyecallit, a subterfuge— that’s it. A subterfuge to get me inside.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Nixon waved the gun toward the tool chest. “Isn’t there some bills in one of them drawers?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French beamed. “Jim, you really surprise me, you really do. Who said you were dumb? Lot of young men wouldn’t’ve taken notice where I keep the bills. Some of them could be in here a thousand times and wouldn’t know where the big cash was kept.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim shifted the gun into his other hand and looked at it as if it was a puzzle he had to solve. Then he pointed it at French’s stomach and with some resolution said, “Get it for me, French. I don’t want to hurt you. Just get the money for me.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Jim, I’d like to. But my hands are still up in the air.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A bell over Jim’s head rang. He wheeled around, letting the gun hand go limp but making a fist out of the other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French said soothingly, “Just the bell that lets me know when a customer pulls up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t go,” Jim warned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French smiled and stretched his hands still higher above his head. “Now that’s not using your head, Jim. Now you know that whoever’s out there’s going to come in here if I don’t go out. The thing to do is, send me out there to wait on him, but keep me covered with the gun, so if I do anything fishy, like trying to jump in the car, you can let me have it. Now isn’t that the sensible thing?” Without waiting for his captor to assent, French lifted the big drop door and walked into the sunlight, blinking slightly. The customer was Fred Snead. Fred married a wealthy widow from Maryland, so he didn’t have to go to work like most men. He didn’t have to do anything he didn’t want to except listen to her. That’s why Fred could be around in the middle of the morning. He was probably on his way to Marty Kleinmetz’s Grille and Lounge downtown to watch television and drink beer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Ten of the regular,” Fred called. “Check the oil for me, too, would you, French? This damn lemon just drinks oil all day.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Buicks do that,” French said. When he lifted the hood to check the oil, Fred pushed open his door and squeezed out. Fred had gotten fat since he married the widow, not that he was any bean pole when he was single.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“And how’s Molly?” French asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Like she always is,” Fred answered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French laughed, because the widow was usually in a bad temper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sure enough, the Buick did need a quart, and while French was dribbling it through the funnel, Fred leaned over the fender, wanting to make conversation. To oblige him, French said, “I hear the Nixon boy quit his job with Ben Youngers.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fred picked a cigarette out of the pack in his shirt—it was one of those gauzy shirts so transparent you could read “Chesterfield” through the pocket—and said, “I bet it’s his mother’s doing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“How do you mean?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know how she is. She told Molly Jim was picking up bad habits with Youngers and his men. Guess he sassed the old lady back once or twice. Guess he’s starting to think a little for himself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You may be right there, about Jim wanting to get out on his own. He’s sitting in the station right now, trying to rob me with a gun.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fred laughed at the joke and asked how much he owed French. It came to $2.90, but Fred gave him three dollar bills and said, “Let’s call it square.” Some of these men, they get a little money and get the idea they’re really high on the hog. When French tried to force a dime on him, Fred Snead wiggled his fat white hand magnanimously and pulled out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“WHAT took so long?” Jim asked shrilly when French returned to the inside of the station.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I had to act natural, Jim,” French explained. “You don’t want Fred Snead smelling a rat and calling down a whole fleet of state cops, now do you Jim?” He snapped his fingers, as if he had forgotten something, then put his hands high over his head again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come on,” Jim said. “Give me the money and let me get out of here.” He paused and thought, finally adding, “I’ll try to send it all back to you when I get the chance.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Why do you want to leave town, Jim? You belong here. People like you. I like you. The Nixons been living in this town ever since I can remember.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I hate this town.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You mustn’t hate this town, Jim, even if your mother . . .”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It’s nothing to do with my mother. Forget my mother. I just want to get on a train and forget everybody in this town.” He lowered his voice, pleading, “But I promise I’ll get this money back to you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Now, there’s no need to do that, Jim. You’ve held me up fair and square, and you don’t owe me a thing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim sucked his lower lip behind his upper and pushed it out in a pout. “Give me the money. Now. Please.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Jim, I’m at your mercy, and I’d like to get the key to the drawer with your money in it, but . . .”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“But what?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I can’t get it with my hands up in the air.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, lower them, why don’t you? Just get the key.” He added, “Or I’ll shoot.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French said, “Funny. The key doesn’t seem to be in the pocket.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim lurched at him. “Dont’—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Try any funny stuff? Now, Jim, you know me better than that. I wouldn’t take any chances with a dangerous armed bandit. I just must have left the key in yesterday’s overalls, that’s all the trouble is. And they’re right in the closet over here, waiting to be washed.” As he walked to the closet and fished around for the overalls, he said, “Now that you’re leaving town, Jim, and I’m financing the trip, you might say, you might tell me what all this is about? Why you quit Ben Youngers and all.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy thought a long while before admitting, “My mother made me quit. Said I was picking up bad ways.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French held up the key for him to see. “Looks like it was in the pants I had on after all.” As he pretended to unlock the drawer, he said, “She has your best interests at heart, Jim. No matter what kind of women they are, our mothers love us. You have to admit that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I guess.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, indeed, I remember my mom telling my father, ‘It isn’t right to let the boy run wild. He ought to be learning a trade’. She had my best interests . . .”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What’s that you’re doing?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French raised his eyebrows at the boy’s alarm. He had been carefully counting out the money into neat piles, now and then pausing to rub the wrinkles out of the older bills. “Don’t shout, Jim. I have your interests at heart. All I’m doing is sorting out the big bills from the little ones. You know these twenties and this fifty are big bills, with special numbers. They might be marked. They’re easy to trace. You must have thought of that. So rather than try to trip you up, I’m giving you the small stuff and you can spend anywhere you like in a pile, and keeping it separate from the big stuff you better keep and spend one at a time, each time in a different place, so the FBI can never track you down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“While we’re at it, another important thing. In some towns, wear old clothes and grow a beard if you can. I don’t know why you can’t. You’re over twenty, and it doesn’t have to be a real thick beard. In fact, it’s better if it’s scraggly and common-looking. The next town you hit, shave it off and dress as snappy as you can. That way, they’ll never catch up with you, because you’ll seem to be a lot of different people. And can you fake a limp?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“No.” Jim made a grab for the money, but French raised his voice so sharply it made Jim stop in surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You can’t! Why, Jim, I don’t believe you’ve put a speck of thought in on this, now have you? I don’t know what to think. Well, I can’t do everything for you, but sorting these bills this way should be help.” French touched his fingers to his forehead, shook his head, and looked Jim square in the face. “Jim,” he said “I’m sick of lying to you. I don’t have your interests at heart. The real reason that I’m playing with this money is that I’m stalling for time. I’ve been stalling ever since Fred Snead left. I knew you were watching all the time, so I knew I couldn’t get any spoken message through to him. But when I made out his receipt, I wrote across it, ‘Help. Police. Robbery’, So the State Police should be here any minute. I’m sorry, Jim.” French folded his hands before him and bowed his head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You must be lying,” Jim cried. “I didn’t see you write no receipt.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sorry, Jim. Now that I see how bad you feel, I wish I hadn’t. But it’s the fact. Remember how the hood was up, so you couldn’t see me from inside the station? That’s when I did it. You should have seen Fred Snead’s face drop!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jim dropped the gun into his pocket and started toward the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Where are you going now?” French asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Out. Away, I guess.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Now, Jim, use your head. What you need isn’t a walk. What you need is an alibi. Go on home and tell your mother the whole story, and you and she can swear you’ve been at home all along. It’ll be your word against mine. Now get going.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy moped out the door and turned toward home. He didn’t even say “thanks,” he was that tired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even before Jim had walked out of sight, the white and silver Ford of the State Police pulled up. Nicholson, the beefy corporal, asked for a full tank of gas and added, “Say, Fred Snead’s spreading the story downtown that the young Nixon held you up.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;French said, “You know Fred’s stories.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yeah,” Nicholson said. He drummed with his fingers on the side of the door, then suddenly grinned and said, “Christ, I’d hate to be in his shoes if his mother ever finds out.”</p>

1885,"The Saxophone Player","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald looked at the address again and reluctantly rang the doorbell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How the hell am I going to ask him?” he wondered. He shuffled his feet and stared at the number on the door. “Maybe he’s not in,” he thought eagerly, half-turning, but he remembered the importance of his mission and stood waiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The door opened a half inch and an eye peered out at him. “Yes?” came a voice muffled by the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hello,” said Donald cheerfully. “May I come in?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Who sent you?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A man by the name of Cappy Williams–said he knew you in the old days.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eye looked at him carefully. “Anybody with you?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The door opened wide enough for Donald to squeeze through. Nobody saw him enter. The door snapped shut quickly behind him, catching a corner of Donald’s seersucker jacket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hey, my jacket’s caught in the door.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, pull it loose. You’re not catching me opening up that door again.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald tugged at his jacket. It was jammed in tight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bother,” said Donald. He pulled again. There was a slight ripping sound. “Think I’ll just take it off and let it hang there,” said Donald with a weak smile. He skinned out of his jacket. “Get it when I leave.” The jacket flopped against the door, two pens and a fifty cent piece falling out of the pockets and clattering on the floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Jesus, cut the racket. Want to wake up every bull in the neighborhood?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh, no,” said Donald. “Are you Irvin Montague?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well here I am,” said Donald cheerfully, looking around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The living room in which he was standing looked like any other except there was a corpse over in a corner with a sheet half over it. Beside it was sitting a man with a fedora pulled down over his eyes, snoring slightly, a bandaged leg up on a stool. Donald had expected at least a few test tubes–maybe even an X-ray machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You are Irvin Montague–a doctor of sorts?” he asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, this is a matter of some delicacy,” continued Donald looking at the man with the fedora.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Don’t be bothering yourself worrying about that bum,” said the doctor. “Talk up, Mac. What’s your trouble? An abortion, maybe?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh, no,” said Donald.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The doctor looked crestfallen. “Gunshot?” he asked severely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Heavens!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Corpse Disposal?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Gosh no.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Nitroglycerine?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Why, what would I want that for?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Look, mac,” said the doctor. “I ain’t got much time. What the hell do you want?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well,” said Donald softly, watching the man in the fedora hat. “I’m a student out at the college. Got an exam tomorrow in Geography–the geography of South America. Three hour exam. Got the picture?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah,” said the doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, the truth of the matter is I’ve only been to one class this year–a class on the resources of the Upper Amazon basin–sugar, rubber, you know. But about the rest of the course, I just don’t know beans.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Beans. So I’m bound to flunk. But if I can get an excuse to miss the exam I can take it again next fall, see? Study all summer and really smash it for maybe a C.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, I was talking to Cappy Williams the other day, and he told me that long ago you used to mix up some sort of drink for students in my predicament that would make ’em pretty sick right in the middle of the exam. Drink it, you see, and then be carried out. Fine medical excuse. No trouble with the dean’s office. Perfect.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And you want me to mix you up a mickey?” The doctor started to laugh. “After all these years–Holy Christ,” he sputtered. The man in the fedora stirred slightly and his eyes opened. “Cut the honking, Montague. You want to wake up every bull in the neighborhood?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The doctor’s laugh stopped as though he’d been choked. “Sorry, nipper, boy. Take it easy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What do you say, doctor?” asked Donald. “It means everything in the world to me. Just can’t go on probation again. I don’t know what my family would say.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The doctor took a step towards him. “Clear outa here, punk. Blow.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Hold on, Montague,” interrupted the man in the fedora. “Out on probation, eh, kid?” Donald was asked, “Who are you gunnin’ with?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Leave him be, nipper,” said the doctor. “Just a young college punk.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I like his style,” said the man in the fedora. “Fix him up, Montague, with what he wants.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Brother, anything to get him the hell outa here.” The doctor walked quickly across the room through a door to what Donald decided must be the examining rooms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I certainly do appreciate it, doctor,” Donald called after him. “Perfectly willing to pay you.” Donald sat down in a chair. The world looked pretty bright, he thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The doctor’s a neat guy, isn’t he,” he asked the man in the fedora.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That punk? Give him half a chance and he’d turn state’s evidence. Damn stoolie.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My, that’s too bad,” said Donald. He started to hum a tune he’d been picking up on the saxophone. “La-te-dum-te-dum-te-dum.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cut the honking, punk. Wanta wake up every bull in the neighborhood?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald laughed and shook his head. “My dear man, we’re in the middle of the city. No bulls. La-te-dum-te-dum-te-dum.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cut it!” the man in the fedora bellowed. “Wanta get blasted in the guts with a .45?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Uncouth beast,” thought Donald as he hummed a quick ending flourish to his tune.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What a fresh punk.” The man in the fedora shook his head. “They’re sure turning ’em out pretty fresh these days. What’s the doc doin’ in there for ya?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He’s mixing me up a drink. You see I’m taking this geography…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Soup, eh? Going to blow a safe. Pretty good for a kid your age.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald took an orange lifesaver out of his trouser’s pocket and popped it into his mouth. “You watch the football team play this year?” he asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m not in the bookie’s racket,” said the man in the fedora. “Gotta spend all my time planning capers. If you don’t plan your caper you get it in the gizzard like this poor sap here,” and he pointed at the corpse in the sheet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald peered across the room. “I suppose that’s one of the doctor’s cadavers,” he said. “Sure would like to take one home with me and stick it in Peter’s bed. Peter’s my roommate. What a card.” He started to laugh. “Oh my.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Cut it, punk.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald stopped. “Bulls?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeh–bulls.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a lovely day for an exam, thought Donald. He wrapped his fingers lovingly around the doctor’s little bottle as he walked into the examination room. The worried eyes and the tremulous voices delighted him. Punks, he thought. Bulls. He now rather liked the word. “Bulls,” he said half aloud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked each proctor in the eye. Ten minutes from now, one of them would be assisting him from the room. He hoped it wouldn’t be the big proctor with the glass eye. But then he could hardly be choosey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He took a seat in the back of the room. Taking the bottle from his pocket, he uncorked it and drank it quickly. “Peppermint,” he whispered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had a moment of panic when he couldn’t find his pencil. But it turned up in the lining of his coat and in a big scrawl he wrote his name across the blue book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perfect, he thought. Ten minutes to go–no after-effects–go out tonight with young Edith and blow my saxophone at the moon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The examination arrived. Donald picked it up daintily between thumb and forefinger and read, “Discuss for three hours the resources of the Upper Amazon basin.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh, bother,” said Donald. “Oh dash it.” He picked up his pencil but it dropped from his trembling fingers and rolled on the floor.</p>

<p>Hey, you. No, you. Yeah, you! No no, not you. Yes—no—. Yes, you. You’re probably wondering how I got here. To tell you the truth it all began with me as a young sprout on the streets of Detroit. The Motor City. The 313. D-town. The Danger Place. The Not a Safe Place at All. What happened on that block in that city next to yours which looked in so many ways so similar to your own? A grotesquerie of grocery stores and baseball parks and fast food drive-thrus, of prom queens and smelly teachers and summer vacations bridged the universe of my adolescence. Every day and every night I walked along this suburban slab with my saxophone held close. I wiped the sweat from my upper lip and played myself a final ballad. But this time, I play the stacato and my saxophone opens like a blinding snake jaw into a portal to another dimension.</p>

<p>If my old life was a Detroit gray scale, my new life is a technicolor phantasmagoria of smash cuts and flashing lights and beautiful people throwing daisies at me. At the Harvard Lampoon my best friends are fruitcakes and my worst friends are raindrops. It’s nothing but sunshine all the time. Instead of breakfast, lunch and dinner we skip straight to desert. We scoop in the sweets to the beat of the music that the band plays for us. And just as the soft serve hits the back of our throats, the first chair alto bursts out of her chair in the orchestra, illuminated like a gas-fired geyser, belting out the notes with waxing bravado.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like that, I am flushed down the portal from whence I came. I am transported back to the stoop and have no choice but to create a magazine about my most young and most misunderstood days. The portal teases me with nostalgic reverie of my past while keeping my feet firmly locked to the castle floors. But even as the portal of youth thrashes about on the pages that follow, I will never forget my roots. I’ll say it once. I’ll say it one thousand times.</p>

<p>Uh oh. I did it again. Fell asleep after all the kids got on the bus, so now I gotta get all these munchkins home in the next ten minutes.

2050,"Guest Lecture by Joseph Campbell at University of Chicago, Transcript 11/24/68","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good evening students. I’d like to begin by thanking those of you who showed up to this lecture. I guess the rest of your classmates decided they’d rather spend Thanksgiving with their families! <em>(light laughter)</em> I’m here today to talk about myths, and how I am living inside of one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, you don’t need to have a PhD to say that human life and mythology share some common features. I say this all time and I am illiterate. Truly anyone can say anything, anytime. But rather than talk about that, I’d like to talk about the time I was approached at a very young age by a hideous old goblin, who told me I could save my starving family by following him into the forest. Next slide, please.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had two holes where his nose should be, and scraggly white hair where his eyes should be. One touch of his wrinkled, leathery hands was enough to make you want to vomit, as I frequently did when he began to appear in my shower every morning for a month. You can see a close up of his fingers here, and here. You could call that fateful day when I followed him into his woodsy hovel my “Call to Adventure” if you will, and the subsequent twelve years I spent trying to escape his labyrinth my “Adventure.” Next slide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But just because I endured a series of trials and hardships does not make me a hero. Refugees and homeless people are certainly not heroes, for example. A hero is marked above all by good deeds. Here’s a shot of me really just going to town on this centaur I had to fight in the labyrinth. Next slide. Ah, and here’s a shot of me signing the agreement to let Schmekel the Goblin “have his way” with my first-born daughter every spring, in exchange for my freedom. The sucker let me go immediately after that. Next slide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>(picture of a playground slide)</em> Oops, wrong “slide.” <em>(winking, light laughter)</em> My daughter in the audience is gonna kill me for all these “Dad jokes,” right Melissa? Wave to the students. That’s my daughter. Wave, Melissa. Okay, next slide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay, and this is actually the wrong slide. Please go one forward. There, this is me standing next to the centaur’s dead body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now I’d like to argue that the patterns we find in mythology are universal and could be psychoanalyzed to reflect humanity’s deepest desires, though because I started this lecture an hour late I’ll instead just wrap things up with the quick argument that my experience was the one true Hero’s Journey, and I am the one true hero. Thank you, all.</p>

<p>1. Toodle-ee-doo! The trumpet song wakes me up—time to canoe to breakfast.</p>

<p>2. I eat slop with the gang. Timmy shows us a scab he got wrestling a bear and we name him our king. Plan for the day: Do boy things with my man friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Uh oh! There’s Susie Schwartz, the hottest girl at Camp Konakwee. She skips to the canteen and seductively dumps a bucket of iced tea on her head. Timmy immediately passes out. Susie throws us a coy little wink as mosquitos devour her body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>4. We play dodgeball, the sport of kings. I hit the fat kid in the face and his chest ripples violently. Even on his dying day, Ol’ Jiggle Tits never lives this down.</p>

<p>5. Lunch: More slop. Susie leads a tie- dye demonstration and the boys come of age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. It’s scorching hot, so we cartwheel to the lake. We tie up Jiggle Tits and swing him into the murky water. Nice! Here at Camp Kweeterkwon, summer is forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7. Darn: Susie skips too close to the forest and is eaten by a bear. The camp declares a state of emergency. Getting in formation, we line the cabins with macaroni dreamcatchers.</p>

2058,"The Life of a Cowboy","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was only five years old when my grandpappy taught me how to shoot a gun. “Pull the trigger and end my suffering,” he begged me, holding the barrel to his head. And I did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A year later, my father gave me my first horse, for going to school. It was dead, and I had to drag its lifeless body eighty miles to school every day. This was because I lived in a very rural area without a bus that I was allowed to bring dead horses on. All the kids made fun of me, since I didn’t fit in with them socially. Also, because of my unorthodox views on assisted suicide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a teenager, my job was to herd cattle. I spent a lot of time chasing cows, because they liked to play tag. When I was out there in the fields, I loved to sing songs about home on the range, like “Take Me Home, Country Roads” and “Yakety Sax.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will never forget the day that I turned 18 and became a man, as it marked the end of a very long stretch of hormone treatment culminating in gender reassignment surgery. I had to perform this surgery to finish my medical school education, which is in my opinion the mark of a true man. On my birthday, father gifted me his old whip, signifying that he was going to retire and I would take over the family business of being a dominatrix. The whip was 100% human leather, which is to say that humans made it, out of cow leather.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later, I met my wife at the local general store, where I was buying extra-small condoms and she was buying one huge dental dam. I knew our relationship would never work out, because of the differences in our interests and races. She was a Native American, and I was a racist. You have to understand that this was a different time when everyone was intolerant, so for me to have been considered a racist back then meant I was extremely, extremely racist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyways, my wife didn’t like how I always called her “Indian,” telling me that the proper term was “Ashkenazi Jewish.” I knew my father would never approve of our marriage, as he did not believe straight couples should marry until everyone had the right to marry. Sure enough, our romance soon ended after she died of dysentery. But not immediately afterwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, in those days, my home was on the range, and my house was repossessed by the bank during the Asian financial crisis of 1997. I lived in Kansas at the time; this is just to give you some temporal context. I worked during the day, and at night I cut loose at my favorite watering hole: a big pool of dirty water by the broken Exxon pipeline. All in all, I’ve loved being a Cowboy, and I especially loved bringing the Super Bowl trophy to Dallas in 1972, as a deliveryman.</p>

2065,"Eulogy of George","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good morning everyone. I know we all loved George. And I know most of you guys probably don’t know me, but George and I go way back, I’m talking like 15, maybe 16 days. I remember the first day I met George. I pulled up next to him. “You know how many of these bad boys exist?”, I said. “Who the hell are you?”, he replied. “One million”, I said. Referring to my Chevrolet Impala. “Guess you could say I’m one in a million,” I told him. That’s when George punched me, fracturing my jaw and causing me to speak with a lisp the rest of my life. But now my wife can’t divorce me, because you just can’t divorce a man with a lisp. I love that man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got to know George pretty well over the next few weeks as I sued him for medical bills. I dropped the assault charges though, because that was a hell of a left hook. Turns out George was a pretty cool guy. We got drinks a few times, sometimes over breakfast. We really bonded over our love of <em>To Catch a Predator</em>, we even thought about trying out for the show a few times. I realize now that I actually totally forgot I was suing him. That sneaky guy! Think I could snag some of that life insurance payout?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This isn’t about me, this is about George and how he is dead. Hm, George talked about his family a lot, I think he really liked them. Well, not everyone. He would go on and on about how much he despised his wife Julia. How he couldn’t stand being with her, and she reminded him of his 2nd grade teacher the way she ate her morning lasagna. So I’m really happy to see her here in the front row. Love is truly something special. Julia, don’t give me that look, he was going to divorce you in a few weeks anyway. Wait a second, Is that John right there behind you?! You were like George’s best friend! Oh man, did George ever get to tell you that your son is actually his? No? Pity, just goes to show that the best time is always now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m going to wrap this up because there’s a 12 hour sale of Dr. Scholl’s shoe inserts going on at Walgreens across the street and I gotta get there before they run out of the ones with the super cool green gel. I guess all I want to get across is that George was my best friend. Some would say he was my only friend but I’m not one to count. The man knew how to cover up an abortion better than anyone I’ve ever known. And he could make killer mocktails with alcohol. In fact, drinks are on me tonight at O’ Hannigans! To George!</p>

2067,"The Dust Bowl","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Football is not what it used to be. During my golden years, AKA the Great Depression, we were <em>all </em>in it for the brain injuries. My own greatest hope was to achieve the American Dream: play a phenomenal game of ‘ball and pass away shortly afterwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything about football was more intense back in the day, especially in my home state of Kansas. Our field was the entire Dust Bowl. Our quarterback Pete was a small tornado we recruited after our original quarterback died in a different tornado. Our football was a football stuffed with dust. That was mostly an aesthetic choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The biggest game of my life ended in a ten-person pile-up. A windstorm was touching down in the next town over, and 60mph gusts were whipping up our dust-field. Pete was even quieter than usual, which was unsettling. The other fellows were struggling as well: our running-back Marvin had Dust Lung, which is like pneumonia but with more dust, and our wide-receiver Thom had a nasty case of Dust Cancer. That was our name for normal cancer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the game, my father said to me, “Son, you know what you have to do.” He meant die and lighten the financial burden on my starving family. More than anything, I wanted to make Father proud—but despite my best efforts, I failed to kick the bucket during the consecutive football seasons of ‘34, ‘35, and ‘36. I spent the 1937 season in a coma, but unfortunately recovered just in time for the 1938 season. The shape of my head would never be the same, and neither would Sunday dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was in my coma, I had this brilliant dream: in it, I run through the dust, kicking up clouds of the stuff with my feet. This other fellow charges towards me, head-on. We both lower our skulls and prepare for the Moment of Impact, fingers crossed that it will be gory and slow. I close my eyes. My parents and siblings cheer in the stands. “Blood!” my kid-sister yells. “We want blood!” A quiet prayer slips past my lips—and dust slips in, like it does every time I open my mouth. The other runner is ten feet away now, five, two—one. “End my life,” he shouts, death-lust thick in his raspy Dust Lung voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

2071,"Ghost Hunters","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>School’s out, plan is a go.&nbsp; It’s officially Halloween.&nbsp; My parents think I’m sleeping over Jimmy’s, his think he’s at Paul’s, Paul told his parents that he’s, “at mine,” and Craig is bringing the flashlights from his orphanage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Craig is late to our meeting out behind the playground.&nbsp; “What you don’t have a watch either, Craig?” Jimmy says.&nbsp; We laugh and realize that this is the best time of our lives.&nbsp; We cherish it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul shows us the ectoplasmic gun he built out of decals and his dad’s Mangum .45.&nbsp; I hope it works as well on ghosts as it did on Craig’s foot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It starts to get dark, and children wearing all sorts of colored costumes take to the street.&nbsp; When the gang war finally stops we begin trick-or-treating. My pillowcase is filled to the brim with chocolate and everyone loved the army man costume.&nbsp; Nobody really understood Craig’s, Dracula with a gunshot in his foot costume, but that was okay because he didn’t have a pillowcase anyway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fog of mystery is in the air as we approach Old Man Vanderhoot’s abandoned mansion, and also a fog of water vapor.&nbsp; Out in the distance, or is it 10 feet away, a wolf howls clichély, startling us.&nbsp; We always were terrified of the French.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Do you really think we’ll see the ghosts of the Vanderhoot’s,” Paul nervously queries as we pass by ghostly rows of geraniums lining the driveway, and two ghoulish abandoned cars which were in spookily pristine conditions.&nbsp; Climbing through the open window, we notice a light on upstairs.&nbsp; In fact, we can even make out the sound of the television running.&nbsp; The ghosts are definitely here, and even in this abandoned house they have managed to wield electricity.&nbsp; Ghost Electricity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of a sudden, ghost footsteps come pounding down the staircase.&nbsp; Paul shoots two waves of plasmic energy at the phantom and it evaporates into a heap on the floor, releasing weird, red, ghost blood.&nbsp; Two more ghosts rush down after the first, screaming and wailing their otherworldly chants in modern English… Ghost English.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paul sends the other two ghosts back to the spirit world from whence they came with two more perfect shots.&nbsp; Looks like all that time spent playing violent video games wasn’t as bad for him as everyone said that time that he got diagnosed with severe epilepsy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We leave the abandoned house as heroes and accomplished ghost hunters and Craig, who couldn’t make it through the window.&nbsp; A pizza delivery man even gives us a large pie on our way out the door and complements our house.&nbsp; How could he possibly know what our houses look like?&nbsp; Still, it was a nice gesture— word must’ve travelled fast that we saved the town from those ghosts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next day our parents tell us we can’t play outside anymore because a murderer is loose in the neighborhood, up at the top of the hill near Vanderhoot Mansion.&nbsp; Spooky, spooky stuff.</p>

2073,"Surf Trip","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll never forget the summer I road-tripped to Hawaii with my two best friends. While it started out as a surf trip, we ended up learning a heck of a lot about ourselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Skip, Benny and I were just some knuckleheads from SoCal when we packed our bags and set out to catch some serious barrel. While we had our fair share of fun, this adventure was <em>anything </em>but smooth. I mean, we really had no idea what in the world we were doing. Our first hiccup came pretty early on when we threw our boards in the trunk of the car and drove straight into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Benny was the first to pass away. He knocked his head pretty good on the windshield when we plowed into the ocean at 60 miles per hour. We always loved making fun of Benny for his <em>huge </em>head. You could could stuff a few grapefruits in there! Skip was in critical condition after his seatbelt jammed and he nearly drowned. Luckily, we got him to the hospital really quickly. Unluckily, he was beyond saving and died soon after our arrival.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In hindsight it was a totally doofus move to throw the car into sports mode and floor it right into the ocean, but how could we have known that? We were kids for crying out loud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Years later, it’s always fun to look back on that trip and think about where we are now. As I explained earlier, Benny and Skip both died because we drove our car into the sea. I’m now a successful accountant with a wife and three beautiful children. Sure, I live a good life. But sometimes I find myself staring out the office window at the breaking waves and craving the feel of the surf wax beneath my toes. Sometimes I think of calling up Skip and Benny to see if they want to shred one last time, until I remember that they both perished on account of us plowing into open water with our car.</p>

2078,"How I Worked My Way to the Top of the Studio","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m stumbling around looking for a bathroom anywhere in this city and I accidentally walk into the President of Warner Brother’s office. “Here for the interview?” he writes on a piece of paper as he finishes his snow cone. At that point the poop was coming out whether I wanted it to or not and I decided his desk was the best place for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You got moxie, kid” I say, thinking he would say it too and we’d both say it in synch. He abruptly stops eating his snow cone and puts it in his briefcase for later. “If you think that even came close to being a display of moxie… then you have gravely underestimated how impressed I was by that.” He starts sucking on the ring pop he’s been wearing and writes “you start in the mail room tomorrow.” It was Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So there I am working in the Warner Brothers mail room. Keep in mind that in 1932, basically the only mail being sent to movie studios was full size pianos. Luckily it was 1994, so a lot of the pianos being sent were the smaller electronic ones. Suffice to say, surrounded by nothing but pianos and having hours of free time every day, I get really good at stacking the pianos into a Piano Mountain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I keep stacking and stacking the pianos, until suddenly they’re taller than the President’s office. And now, since I can get higher up than him on my pianos, that means that technically, I can see him masturbating into his slurpee machine through the window. The blackmail works perfectly and he gives me his job. Slurpee machines are strictly forbidden on the Warner Brothers lot.</p>

2080,"President Nice Guy","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Richard Holton, our first Nice Guy president, eased out of the womb on December 24, 1921, giving doctors plenty of time to go enjoy their Christmas. His first word was a smile. The warmest of five children, Richard quickly gained a reputation as a kindness prodigy. While other toddlers struggled to form full sentences, Richard was able to say things like, “How was your day?” and truly care about the answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite his résumé’s focus on other people’s accomplishments, Richard was admitted to college with a scholarship as generous as he was. He entered school excited to learn, but professors soon asked him to skip class. It was hard to teach over all that applause. Richard majored in Compliments and graduated top study-buddy in his class. He won a national debate championship after agreeing to disagree with his opponents. Senior year, he was elected homecoming king, homecoming queen, and dean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His last name was officially changed to Nice Guy after a census taker was blown away by his patience. Out of humility, Richard insisted that his name be changed back to Holton. When his court appeal was denied, Nice Guy graciously accepted the result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After making his local congressman blush to death, Richard became Representative Nice Guy. Voters elected him unanimously, undeterred by his youth and stated disinterest in the position. By the end of his first day on Capitol Hill, all politicians belonged to one party. He took the second day off to donate organs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In November 1955, he gave his famed speech, “You All Seem Wonderful, But I Would Like to Retire, Please.” The American people knew it was time for President Nice Guy. He refused to run a dirty campaign or any campaign at all. He became the first candidate to openly endorse his opponent. By mid-July, they called off the election and gave Nice Guy the White House. The sitting president was thrilled; Nice Guy personally helped him move out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defining move of his presidency was remembering everyone’s birthday. Not wanting to hog the spotlight, he resigned after three weeks. President Nice Guy’s reverence for foreign nations was reflected in his decision to move to one. But the voters were wise to his kind tricks, and they elected him to 14 more terms via write-in ballot. He died at the age of Young at Heart while attempting to tunnel out of the White House.</p>

2084,"Film Noir","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The year was December 17th, winter to be exact. Outside my office it was a wet, dark afternoon—the type of afternoon you don’t bring home to meet mother. Inside I sat, drowning my sorrows in my signature cocktail, scotch and cup, when she walked in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had a body that could get glue off and legs that went on for miles. Her face could make all the holy angels in heaven really really horny. Her shoes didn’t match her dress. She came in frantically saying something about how her sister had gone missing after hanging around a “bad crowd” and she wanted me, the city’s only private detective open past 5pm on a Sunday, to track her down. The girl had gone bananas… But maybe just banana enough to get me out my slump.&nbsp; Looked like my bucket of bourbon appletini tonight would be a double.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I told her the only thing she had to fear is that I would find her too fast, or that she was already murdered. Either way I would need some time to get the facts straight and a stiff gin and tonic—shaken, hold the tonic. The girl’s name was Bella Boscoe, and her sister’s name was Stella Scoscoe, a real twisty gal who lived downtown and hung out at a dirty joint called “The Punky Puss.” I checked around and apparently she’d been dating Slim Jim Jackson, a hefty fella who went by the name of “Husky Joe.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I walked into the club to be greeted by the stench of vomit, coming from my vomit-covered jacket. Half the town was at this watering hole where a lady with fruit on her head was singing about some guy who left her. I would have to use all the skills I had learned over the years in order to remain unseen and quiet—<em>too</em> quiet… After snooping around the room for a bit I found Husky Joe, sitting at the craps table, bragging to his goombas about all his favorite crimes. I ordered a whiskey and vodka neat at the bar and inconspicuously stared at him unblinkingly waiting for him to make a move. He finally stepped out into the alley for a smoke, so I followed behind and once we turned off the strip, I fired two warning shots directly into his back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Freeze, punk!” I shouted as he dropped to the floor out of fear and intimidation. Then I questioned him for half an hour. He wasn’t budging. This guy was good. But I noticed something in his criminal pocket. A love letter from Stella Scoscoe. <em>My dearest Joe, I’ll love you forever. If we’re ever separated, I’ll always return to the old meat freezer from our youth.</em> Always? That was tonight!</p>

<p>Klugg can’t fly like other fairies but he claims to be fifty percent crawdad. I think that’s a lie — he looks more like eighty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I wished for a fairy on my ninth birthday I got Klugg: The Bayou Swamp King. He climbed out a dumpster behind Mama’s favorite Red Lobster and followed me home, running. He spent the first month asking whether I could make his room (my closet) any more dark and damp. He spent the second month asking if his room (my room) could be Big Pig Central.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jambalaya, fan boats, molting parties, voodoo teeth, spicy, Mardi Gras Katrina BBQ, and Klugg. Each of them in my backyard. “Hey, baby boo. That a sweet mump mump.” — Klugg</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Klugg’s always granting me wishes for mud tubs I don’t want. He gets all happy and wooshy when I say he can use it cause it’s the one thing that helps his “Gumbo Skin.” Gumbo Skin happens when your shrimps eat too many taters off your tummy. It’s not contagious, so Klugg lets me touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Klugg’s swamp buds are Guzer, Rub Rub, Ying Bing, and Rooff, and Hetler. Those old boys know how to chug bead buckets. Klugg’s best at it cause when he chugs beads it’s like “Oh mama, Klugg chug like goose milk yum.”</p>

<p><strong>Winning the Lottery</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pitching a Perfect Game</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first game of the season, and I felt good. I stood on the mound confidently, ready to throw a killer first pitch to my best friend, Rigley. I launched a curveball into the bottom of the strike zone. Rigley hit a home run and went on to pitch a perfect game.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lightning Striking Twice</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s actually pretty common for lightning to strike the same place twice. Rigley told me that it’s happened to him like a million times and that’s how come I can park in handicap spots when he’s in the car.</p>

2095,"My Trip to Cleveland","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m going to be honest with you, reader—my sophomore fall didn’t get off to a great start. Sure, I had a few things going for me: a n+1 suite in Adams (the “Adams of the Quad,” which is Pfoho), an early admit offer from the Porcellian Club, the healthy sex life I had maintained since middle school, and a regular brain with no learning disorders. But still, I felt like there was a gaping void in my life that could never be fulfilled, no matter how many drugs I took away from friends who were trying to stay clean or how much meaningless sex I saved women from by being an incredibly selfless lover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suffice it to say, I was depressed, and since suicide wasn’t an option given my fear of death, I knew I needed to find some kind of cure. So in order to overcome my death-phobia, I turned to Eastern philosophy, but found the concept of reincarnation even scarier than the already extremely terrifying idea of going to heaven. Therefore, without the comforting certainty that death would be the end of all existence, suicide remained something I could only watch Pennsylvania State Treasurer Budd Dwyer (R-PA) do on YouTube or in the hundreds of flip book animations I had drawn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I began to see a psychiatrist, and after a few months of going out with her, I made an appointment with an analyst. While some people may dislike the idea of paying $200 to lie on a leather couch while some quack with a clipboard administers electroconvulsive shocks to your body whenever Dr. Milgram orders him to do so, I actually found it pretty helpful. For example, when I told my analyst about my fantasy where I walk into Sanders Theater with a fully loaded AR-15 to deliver a lecture on how to disarm an active shooter, he said it was just an expression of my resentment towards my father, who, back in the 80s, became the first “good guy with a gun” after he shot John Lennon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, my analyst and I decided that it would do me some good to take a break and just get away from it all, so I applied to study abroad in Paris. But boy, did I feel stupid when I found out that, instead of applying to study in Paris, <em>France</em>, I had accidentally joined an ISIS training camp in Abu Kamal, Syria. Luckily, after only a week of training, I was sent home when a camp counselor caught me drawing a cartoon of Muhammad getting his dick sucked while I was <em>in the girls’ dormitory after lights out.</em></p>

<p>As luck would have it, my flight back to Boston was hijacked by terrorists, who wanted to replicate the horrors of 9/11 by crashing the plane into a field in Pennsylvania. Luckily, I was able to overpower the terrorists and redirect the flight into the Pentagon. Anyways, here are some photos of when I went to Cleveland six years ago.</p>

2098,"My Feminism","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though it’s harder than ever before to be a woman, it’s easier than ever to be a feminist. Back in the olden times, being a feminist meant not wearing any makeup, not shaving your legs, and shaving your head in order to be more equal to bald men. Nowadays, it is also feminist to blow all the guys on the basketball team (I am one away from achieving this). People shouldn’t call me a slut, but if they did, that would be fine with me, because of my feminism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One big achievement of my feminism is that men can be feminist too. Let’s do a little thought experiment. Imagine a feminist. Did you imagine a man, or a woman? A <em>woman</em>, right? No. The feminist I was thinking of was a gay man. That’s fucked up. Men can be feminist in lots of ways, such as being gay, working as a male nurse, and saying thank you after sex.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another part of my feminism is “leaning in,” and the main tenet of “lean in” feminism is leaning in so hard to the boardroom table at a business meetings that you repeatedly bash your head into the table, rendering yourself unconscious and allowing the men to have the meeting as planned without hearing the voices of women.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>True, corporate feminism only benefits a small, select group of women, but this is not a problem if you are a part of that group. You should demand to be treated so much like a man that you are then able to subjugate other women. As such, if you choose to have children, you should forget about their existences as soon as they are born and pass them off to a female caretaker of lower social status than yourself. Try and remember your children’s names at least until they’re seventeen years old, so that you can give their names to admissions officers when you’re making the large donation that will assure them a spot at an Ivy League college.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe my feminism doesn’t sound so great. But just remember, it <em>is </em>great. And even if it was not, it’s the best that I have, and also gender is made-up concept which does nothing but limit the range of human possibilities, and also all theoretical discussions are irrelevant and futile given that we live in a Matrix-style virtual reality in which certain unknowable godlike forces determine what we take to meaningful or even existent at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This being said, the key platform of my feminism is these 100 issues:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Emergency contraception.</strong> Plan B should be renamed Plan A.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Body image.</strong> Women can come in all shapes and sizes, like pear, apple, pineapple, inverted triangle, helix, small square, tallpointy, backwards, sconce, scone, moan, pone, and those are all of them. Advertisements set an unrealistic standard for women’s bodies; for example, when I see an ad for a sleek car or a silver watch, I think to myself, “There’s no way I could look like that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Telling women to smile.</strong> Whenever I get my photo taken, people tell me to smile. As a feminist statement, I always stick my tongue out and pretend to choke to death as the picture is being taken. This ruins every photo that I am in. It’s so unfair that there aren’t any photos of me in which I am not pretending to choke and die.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sex.</strong> Sex is power, power is electricity, electricity is when a charge is placed in a non-zero electric field whose magnitude is given by Coulomb’s Law, and… I lost track of where this was going.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Representation.</strong> It is so important to see women around you. However, I almost never see other women, especially when I’m standing alone in the middle of a large cornfield. Why are all scarecrows men? When I turn on the television, I never see women; I only see static, because I haven’t paid my cable bill in months. However, I can tell from reading old copies of TV Guide from 2002 that women are only offered certain roles: the hot sidekick, the hot love interest, the hot crazy girl, the hot nerd, and the hot old crone feeding pigeons on the street who appears in the background in one scene. Women should be able to play whatever roles they want, especially if that role is stuffing their clothing with hay and standing in a field for 24 hours a day to ward off birds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Abortion.</strong> I know that as a feminist, I’m supposed to support abortion and get as many abortions as possible. But do I have to like it? To be honest, I feel kind of weird about impregnating myself every month, only to get an abortion the next. Six abortions a year (seven on a leap year) takes a toll.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mansplaining.</strong> Whenever I go to Planned Parenthood to get my free abortion, as was promised to me by the Founding Mothers, the male doctors always says, “I think you are getting too many abortions.” Then when I plug my ears and scream unceasingly for as long as I can, the male doctors are always interrupting me, saying, “Stop!” and “Hold her down!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gendered toys.</strong> Why do boys and girls need different toys? When I was a kid, my brothers all got chemistry sets for Christmas, while I got no gifts and instead fashioned a small doll out of loose hairs I gathered from the floor. It kept falling apart. I think anyone could play with that toy, and grow up to be the accomplished chemist I am today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gendered soaps.</strong> Why do men and women need different soaps? When I was a kid, the only soap I used was thrown to me in a bucket as I was kept in a very deep hole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Wage gap.</strong> Every time I make $1, I immediately deposit it at the bank. After I hand it over, I have no idea where it goes, and I have no money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know that we said there were 100 issues facing women today and I have named 10, but this, in itself, is an important lesson about being a woman: always exaggerate how bad it is, or else no one will listen to you</p>

2100,Vanitas,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you finally have this issue in your hands, you’re probably wondering one thing and one thing only: two things. First, what is this, and second, how much can I sell it for? Well, I love to disappoint, but the <em>Lampoon </em>magazine is worth less than the paper I handwrite each issue on. The only question you have now is, “What is this issue about?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This issue is about rare, special things that come about once in a lifetime, like this issue. It’s also about other rare things I know about, like beauty and love. I know about beauty from when I looked in the mirror for the first time. I thought, “I need a word to describe the opposite of what I am seeing.” I learned about love when I looked up the word “lope” in the dictionary while writing a diary entry about when I saw a tall, thin dog running.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This issue is also about things that make you say “wow,” like when I hand you a note that says, “Say ‘wow’ out loud right now or I’ll blow your brains out. Also, please read my screenplay about a young Asian-American woman who just might learn a little something along the way. The film touches on the big questions like death, <em>dis</em>-organized religion, the so-called ‘Prozac Nation,’ and it is not about race in any way. Be honest, like, tell me what you <em>really </em>think, but also I have a gun to your head.” Many people have read my screenplay, and they always say, “Wow!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This issue is about how beautiful the Grand Canyon looks as you’re diving into it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This issue is also about valuable objects, like a huge, golden, I dunno, chalice, and it’s like, encrusted in jewels, and it’s so shiny that people cry when they look at it and say, “That’s so cool, Alice, we’re so sorry that we voted you ‘Most Changed Since Freshmen Year’ in a passive-aggressive way.” Then I’ll be like, “I forgive you,” but I secretly don’t. I’m just waiting to make my next move (Queen to F7, putting myself in checkmate and making me the first person to lose 500 straight games against the chess-playing AI Deep Blue.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might think that because of the nature of time, <em>every </em>moment is unique, meaning that all of reality is in fact rare and special. Of course, yes, I have thought of this too. I did not copy that sentence from an Internet forum. But to think that everything is special and beautiful requires a cheerful, optimistic worldview that I do not have. I think everything is bad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyways, this issue is about diamonds. That’s it. They say diamonds are a girl’s best friend, which explains why I have no real friends, but doesn’t explain why I also have no diamonds. They say that a dog is a man’s best friend, but that doesn’t explain why I saw a man and a dog arguing at a bus station last week. They say that this Vanitas is too repetitive, but that doesn’t explain why they say that this Vanitas is too repetitive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you may have intuited, this issue will be divided into five thematic parts: “Once,” which is about things that happen one time, “In,” which is about things inside of other things, “A,” which is about the last letter of the alphabet, Z, “Blue,” which details the origin story of the Blue Man Group, and “Reflections,” which is about the victories, defeats, and little surprises from my time growing up in the Harvard Lampoon.</p>

2104,"A Quest","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m embarking on a quest to personally give a big thumbs-up to the child who made my iPhone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day 1: The Flight. I sleep for 13 1⁄2 hours of my 14 hour flight to Suzhou, China. I’m thinking about what I’m gonna do when I find this kid. Then I remember: give him (or her) a big thumbs-up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day 2: Finding the Child. Shanghai is a big city, and there are a lot of kids here. It almost seems like any one of them could have made my iPhone. Nǐ zuò wǒ de iPhone? This is something I looked up on my iPhone, and it means, “did you make my iPhone?” I start asking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day 3: Bump in the Road. I have not been keeping track of the children I ask, and I’m starting to ask some repeat kids. It’s going to be slow-going finding the kid who made my iPhone unless I step up my organization game. Big time!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day 4: Shanghai. Shanghai is an expensive city. But I am a very rich man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day 5: At the Hotel Bar. A well-groomed Chinese businessman tried to tell me that capitalism</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>involves a complex network of labor division, and there is not any one person who made my</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>iPhone, and certainly not a child. I laugh along. “I must seem so naive! Kinda like the child who</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>made your iPhone– what’s his name again?” “Guō Tái-míng,” he said, before he could stop</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>himself. Bingo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day 7: The Factory. The place was totally empty. No employees, no assembly lines,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>nothing. “Guō?” I shouted, hearing only an echo. Then a small noise from a strange door. I opened it slowly, revealing a gorgeous study lined with mahogany and books. At a desk was a small boy, examining his handiwork with a monocle, making new dints here and there with a small chisel. He looked up at me and smiled. “Have you come to give me a big thumbs up?” I was dumbfounded. I extended two big thumbs upward. “Thanks,” he said, “I appreciate it.” He put down his chisel and gazed out of his window. “You know, I really am lucky. Not everyone loves what they do.”</p>

2114,"Ray Charles","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For forty years I’ve been Ray Charles’s private caretaker, helping make his dreams come true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll never forget the day Ray decided to be a musician. I’d sat him down in front of his best and only friend, the radio, when little Ray asked if he could make music too. So I pulled up a coffee table and told Ray to start playing. With each imaginary note he pressed, I’d sing, “Bum bum bum.” Of course, Ray was a natural.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After playing a gig at the hottest venue in the ward, “The Janitor’s Closet,” and listening to his favorite record, Ambiance and Applause, Ray was approached by a famous music producer. “I’m a famous music producer and I’d like to sign you,” I told him in my big shot music producer voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After scribbling on some papers with an out-of-ink pen, Ray’s contract was in place and it was time for him to move to the big city. The trip was easy: Ray flapped his arms as I blew cold air in his face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The happiest I ever saw Ray was when he got to play at Radio City Music House: a school for the deaf I modeled after Radio City Music Hall. In a drafty auditorium, deaf kids watched Ray play his hits on a desk while Ray listened to me hum them. When he finished, the kids burst into applause, content with hearing exactly as much as Ray saw: nothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, Ray became more than just a musical pioneer: he became a civil rights activist. I couldn’t have been prouder listening to my brilliant white patient deliver impassioned speeches as if he were black.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was time to reward Ray for his success so I offered him the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a five-pound weight I stole from the hospital gym. Ray accepted: “People ask me if it’s hard overcoming my disability. No. But it’s nearly impossible to overcome my anxiety that everyone I know has the same voice.”</p>

2117,Proposal,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A successful relationship is about listening. That’s why, when my longtime girlfriend started hinting at moving things to the next level, I took her to a fancy Italian place and proposed that we recreate the spaghetti scene from Lady and the Tramp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Wait—so you’re not asking me to marry you?” she stammered, repeating the exact same thing she<br>had said last week when I accidentally proposed to her sister. “Why would you think that? I never even gave you a ring!” I replied, gesturing to the clump of pasta I had just removed from an engagement ring-box and immediately realizing how she might’ve thought that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This made me feel like a real asshole—a big, fat, stupid, ugly, good-for-nothing, down-on-my-luck,<br>misunderstood, shy, sensitive, too-pure-for-this-world capital-A retArd. And I felt even worse when I saw that the pasta had gotten all tangled up and somehow managed to spell “MARRY ME” in huge capital letters across the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, my girlfriend soon began to perk up, and after a little extra cajoling, agreed to recreate the spaghetti scene. “You know, you might just be the best thing that’s ever happened to me” I said, staring lovingly into her beautiful blue blouse. “Now hold this camcorder while I let the dogs out of their cages.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took over fifty takes to nail the scene, but that was to be expected. After all, the dogs were first-time directors, and I kept spitting out my pasta because it tasted like a disgusting mix of flour, eggs, water and salt. It was all worth it though. When we finally kissed, I felt an incredible rush of happiness—mostly because our lips had created a pipeline that allowed me to suck the pasta from my girlfriend’s mouth into my own, but also because I was in love!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that I proposed and she said, “No.”</p>

2147,"Store Closing","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To Our Valued Customers,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I regret to inform you that here at Frank’s Drugstore and Candy Emporium will be closing our doors for good this Friday. After only a handful of months and a couple dozen handfuls of lawsuits, I find that we can no longer provide for your pharmaceutical and/or sugar-tooth needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I, Frank “Candyman” Jerrigan, started this store with one simple goal: to make drugstores more fun. Also, to make candy stores more serious. I envisioned kids finding their Smarties in the same aisle that their parents found their Vicodin. I fantasized about Xanax in Pez dispensers and M&amp;Ms in pill bottles. I had a wet dream of a fondue fountain overflowing with chocolate flavored cough syrup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, that dream, like several of my former customers, dies. It’s tough to say where it all went wrong. Personally, I blame fluctuations in global mint prices over quarter three of fiscal year 2016 that undermined East Asian supply chains and destabilized the prescription hemorrhoid cream market. Others point to the numerous cases of preschool- ers found in opium dens after developing opiate addictions from my patented Mystery Bags O’ Fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as our remaining assets go, we have none. But I’d like to end with a note on dreams. Dreams are really powerful. Especially when you’ve consistently mistaken Valium for Tic Tacs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And with that, I’d like to bid adieu to what few customers we still have and invite all of you to the grand opening of my new store, Sex Toys ‘R Us.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Episode 2</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arthur and Elton both develop a crush on a wench at the local gruel joint. They each try to win her affection, with Arthur offering her a spot as his queen, and Elton romantically telling her he’s gay. Things escalate: Arthur and George’s house becomes divided, and the two engage in emotional and actual warfare until the wench makes her decision. She likes them equally.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 3</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pair adopt an orphan boy, and begin parenthood by going to his&nbsp;first day of kindergarten. Arthur and Elton quickly become popular – amazing the kids with their chivalry and sexually-ambiguous living situation – and they become co-principals of the school. They hand the mantle of principal on to the orphan boy as a sign of their love. The school collapses in a day.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 4</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elton and Arthur try to sneak into a movie. While forming their plan Arthur does some cheeky one-liners, but Elton does way more cocaine than that. Elton sits on Arthur’s shoulders and they wear a huge trench coat to disguise themselves as an adult. A child runs into the theater shouting, “Help, I need an adult to disarm the bomb in the orphanage!” Elton sees that the jig is up and reveals that he can’t help because he and Arthur are not an adult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Episode 5</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elton decides to&nbsp;fly to the big city to try and “make it”. Arthur tries to replace Elton, but&nbsp;finds it ineffective to hang out with inanimate objects or himself dressed as Elton. Arthur, determined to get his friend back, hops on Elton’s pet dragon and boards Elton’s plane in mid-air. The pilot sees the legendary king on a dragon and passes out after a very specific set of PTSD&nbsp;flashbacks. Arthur and Elton&nbsp;fight through the ensuing laugh track to get to the cockpit, and Elton mutters “Elton ain’t goin’ nowhere, baby” as they&nbsp;fly into the sunset.</p>

2163,Vanagon,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ever since I was little, I wanted a vanagon. I worked for fifty years to get one — mailroom all the way up to manager — and now my shitty kid won’t stop fucking his girlfriend in it. I’m pretty sure he knows I know. My pride and joy, defiled every night by my teenage son and his girlfriend, who he met because they both play oboe in the high school band. I tried sleeping in it to deter him, but he just used the front seat. Not a fun wakeup. </p>

2166,Sunglasses,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so excited when I got my first pair of sun-glasses, because I was able to see things that were very far away as if they were up close, in the sun. “Are you much of a birdwatcher?” the shop owner asked when I bought them. What an idiot, I thought. “These are for seeing in the sun,” I told him. “Well, yes,” he replied, and rang up the rest of my purchase--a book about birds and a pair of glasses that had really dark lenses--in silence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book about birds proved to be an okay gift for my niece, Karl, and the glasses with dark lenses were excellent for shutting out the light when I wanted to go to sleep at night. But best of all were my sunglasses, which I wore every day. I had only three complaints. First, after using my sunglasses to look directly into the sun, as I liked to see it very close up, I developed irreversible macular degeneration. Secondly, instead of making me appear more cool, as I had heard would happen, men often became angry when I approached them wearing my sunglasses, which I used to look directly at their crotches, as I liked to see their crotches very close up.</p>

<p>Hey Guys!<br>I’m sending you this email to invite you to help with my crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m currently in the market for a bell. I saw one I really liked last month. One hundred percent bronze, solid construction, nice tone, and it was made pretty humanely. It’s a little heavy – 13.5 tons – and because bells cost $2000 per ton, it costs $27,000. I just don’t have that kind of money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bell is in China right now. That’s where they make these things. Transportation isn’t a big issue though. My guy at the bell company says that once you get them on their sides, they roll with no problem. He’ll roll them anywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reason I need this bell is because of my sleep disorder. If you know me (and you don’t have to to donate) you know how hard it is for me to get up in the morning. Soon eight o’clock becomes nine o’clock and I’m left&nbsp;wondering where my day went. But this bell? It will be too loud to ignore. It has to be because it’s so big. If it’s not, it will still be fun to look at. Just the anticipation of looking at it will be reason to wake up in the morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve already cleared a space in my backyard for the bell so everything’s ready on my end. I don’t expect any objections from the neighbors because this bell is so beautiful. Big bells double property values.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All I need from you guys is donations. Give as much as you can but make sure it’s a lot because this thing is expensive. Whoever gives the most will get to ring the bell anytime they want, one time only.</p>

2191,"Why I Wish I Was a Green Boy Instead of a Blue Boy","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was born a blue boy, but my whole life I’ve wanted to be a big green boy. Green boys get to be funny and fun and exciting, while as a blue boy I am constantly let down by my unfortunate blue-boyness. Green boys get to look like well fed grass and count money and pick up girls and say “boo-yeah daddyo” while us blue or tan boys are left saying “bow-wow fippy” in an ironic way that is un-fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was born like a boy is born my family had great hopes that I would be born, if not a green boy, then at least a yellow-green or sea-green boy. I too had great hopes as I was being born that<br>I would be a green boy. But as I looked down to my feet I was very disappointed to find that they were the feet of a very blue-boy, a dark blue boy at that, even under the florescent lights of the<br>supermarket parking lot. My parents hoped that, while born a blue boy, I would mature mauve then maybe even travel clockwise along the color-boy-wheel settling at a nice light-yellow boy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as of writing this, I am still very much a blue-boy. I am prone to blue-boy things like crying and not being able to enjoy certain fruits and not having any pets and not being able to drink a beer in one whole gulp. Sometimes if I look in the mirror and really think big-green boy thoughts and say to myself that I’m green like green pea soup I can see myself almost as a green boy, definitely a lighter blue boy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every month in the mail at green boy houses come letters from the government with compliments like “wow, has a green boy ever been as green as you!?” and “as a green boy myself, I am shocked by how like a fresh spring vegetable you are. You are as green as a really relaxed green frog that is sitting on some nice green moss.” Us blue boys get passive aggressive death threats from our neighbors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When green boys go to the fish market they can get wild caught Alaskan tilapia while blue boys have to stick our hands in the ice and ask the workers if we can please have some farm raised Chilean tilapa. We blue boys are also the workers at the fish markets so we are actually making ourselves put our hands in the ice and beg ourselves for the farm raised chilean tilapa. This is self hatred and is unhealthy and just part of being a blue boy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Green boys get to go to dances with all the girls that they’ve picked up and admire how much they look like a fresh-spring roll in the big mirrors at the Ritz. Their dates always know that the green boys will say nice things and that they will be a very handsome couple with the green boys because green is the color that is very complimentary. Meanwhile us blue boys are not at the<br>dances. We are thinking about Fourier socialism and being unhappy and smoking cigarettes and thinking about how under Fourier socialism it would only be fair that the green boys get a bigger slice of the pie.</p>

2201,"The Tango at Chainsaw Lake","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Every summer, the brothers of ΔΨΩ go on a retreat to Chainsaw Lake, but this last trip was complicated by murder. This event will forever be known as...</em> <strong><em>THE TANGO AT CHAINSAW LAKE</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You got 50 brothers in one cabin and of course Kyle is the one who doesn’t finish his beer. That was when we suspected he was dead, but more importantly that was when we knew he was out of the frat. The knife through his heart might have tipped us off more if that weren’t just a normal thing we did at Chainsaw Lake for fun. Hell, his jersey wasn’t even the bloodiest in the room. That honor belonged to Bryce “The Rice” muthafuckin Johnson, the local serial-murderer. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So we try to find who killed Kyle, since he also killed our buzz. We knew we had to keep the operation secret to not alarm the locals. There hadn’t been a major crime or explosion here since back when the place was called Chainsaw Elementary School and Rare Bird Sanctuary and Lake, and that had been days ago. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I take the helm as lead investigator. Eddy takes on the role of 2nd lead. Bryce goes off to do his own thing. We begin with Kyle’s room, which is so full of unfinished beer that it’s a wonder I didn’t kill him sooner than I did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wait, whoops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, next we eliminated suspects. We knew it couldn’t be Richard because he was our frat<br>dog. And it couldn’t be Dog McDoggins because he was dealing with crippling depression. And it couldn’t be Lenny on account of his one arm being smaller than the other, like a sort of vestigial arm. We’re actually still not sure it wasn’t Bryce but we’ll take his word on it. And it couldn’t be Tom because he’s a baby for cryin' out loud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That left us with 43 brothers without excuses or alibis, so it really spared us a lot of trouble when we ruled it a suicide. With the investigation finished, we crowded around Kyle, teary-eyed, and finished his beer—together.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>— The doctor accidentally gives my parents the placenta and throws me away. My parents raise the placenta for 4-5 years before they realize their mistake. However upon meeting me they immediately give me up for adoption due to my cystic fibrosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>— The doctor thinks I am conjoined twins but really my penis is just an exact body double of me. The doctor separates us, leaving me incapable of ever having sex. However my penis-double-of-me has his own penis, and he regularly picks up girls to have sex with them (which I cannot do). He is six inches tall. Despite all this, we grow up together and are very close friends, until years later he commits an unforgivable but unrelated betrayal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>— After I am born, they put me in the hospital nursery. The nursery is too crowded and I end up rolling over and kissing a baby of the same gender, which is gay.</p>

<p>— The soft spot on the top of my head never closes but instead grows even more pronounced. The schoolyard kids compete to throw candies into it and when it rains I have to repeatedly thrust my head downwards to empty it out. If I forget to do this the birds will bathe in it. I am allergic to birds, as they cause me to grow a scalp rash that is even more enticing to birds.</p>

2211,"Chimney Sweep","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chimney sweeping is what I was born to do since I have no arms or legs. Doctors called my missing limbs a pity or a travesty, but my parents called them chimney brush slots. I was put to work immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the other kids have to use both hands to brush, the suckers. I brush everywhere that I walk or climb or exist. I’m the most popular chimney sweep in London – not only do I have the most brushes, but I do it for free. Partly because of a love of the trade, but mostly because they refuse to pay orphans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good sweeping starts with the uniform. I wear only a dirty cap, marking me as a grade-A sweeper and a quadriplegic. Once in the chimney, other kids waste time with two-handed brushing or suffocation. Instead I wriggle upwards while waving my arms and legs and convulsing. I got better than the older kids by studying the inchworm, nature’s chimney sweep. I may have the mind of a 9 year old, but I have the lungs of a much unhealthier 9 year old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My least favorite days are when the constable is about. He’s always after us street kids – not to grope us or anything. That was the last constable. This constable just wants to see us rot in prison. I always rely on my brush-feet to carry me to safety; I don’t need to be faster than the constable, I just have to brush faster than the other kids. While I am always the fastest brusher, the other kids can actually run, so I always spend the night in prison. The fluttering of my brushes in my escape attempts leave the cell impeccably clean – every time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My brushing skills come from my training. I was dropped into my first chimney as a baby, and whatever chimney-cleaning secrets didn’t come naturally to me were very quickly learned as I tumbled down that chimney. This was a rite of passage. What fell into that chimney was a baby, but what emerged was a man, covered in soot. We don’t know who that guy was, but I emerged right after him, a limbless baby covered in soot – and a damn-good sweeper.</p>

2213,"A Man with a Limp and Three Glass Eyes","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who am I? I’m the guy who sits in the bar all day and waits for some tall dark and handsome hero to come along, so that I can offer some guidance with my tootle-lootin dialect. I’m the booter-tooter man. At least that’s what all the fellers down here at the bar in Tomaloke, New Mexico call me. A real ham is what I am.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yessir, you would know me by my short stature, graying hair and missing jomper-chompers. When anyone of interest rides into town they usually come plop their hind-legs about four seats down from me at the bar. This is the perfect distance for me to look over with my glass eyes and ask them what in the hell a stranger is doing in these parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These heroes turn to me and usually say something witty (one just threw up on himself), then call me “old-timer” and take a drink from their whiskey. Now this really tickles something inside of me (not sure if it’s sexual or not). I tell them about all the kidnappings of pretty girls that been happenin round the town lately. Or the pass just out of town where old five-legged Sam uses his five legs to rob you of your valuables. Or any sorts of bruh-haha (if you don’t know what that means you can go on and piss up your plumpie).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These stories aren’t true, I just love tellin em’. I’m just an old coot who plays his part in something greater than me. These strangers usually get in a real fuss about these kidnapped girls and start riding off into the nearest sunset. But never in the sunset that leads to five-legged Sam. Nope seems like every one of these damn heroes wants to go rescue some fair maiden. I just don’t get it. Five legged Sam is a real problem around these parts accounting of his seven appendages, but none of these strong-jawed strangers will get within a mile of him.</p>

2215,"Last Day at the Zoo","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After serving as head zookeeper for 25 years and chief hunting assistant during a disastrous week-long rebranding attempt, I was finally hanging up my boots. While my days of curb stomping misbehaving animals were over, my days of reminiscing about the curb stomping had only just begun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I walked into the zoo for the very last time, my arrival was met with loud cheers from the gorillas, the sign language equivalent of loud cheers from the more intelligent gorillas, and enthusiastic snaps from the super-intelligent gorilla who dabbled in slam poetry. I felt pretty disappointed because I thought the gorillas might do something special for my last day, rather than just giving me their usual welcome. However, my sour mood didn’t last long once I realized that such blatant disrespect warranted at least three curb stompings. The goodbye lunch my coworkers organized also helped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the afternoon, I went around to each exhibit one final time, telling the animals what I really thought of them. Since only the good animals were left, I told them that they were all amazing, especially when paired with a full-bodied red. They all howled with laughter because they knew I was just kidding. “We would obviously pair better with something more fruity,” the super-intelligent gorilla signed sarcastically. Out of all the things I was leaving behind, I would miss our light-hearted banter the second most.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the day drew to a close, nostalgia got the better of me and I stopped by the first enclosure I ever cleaned. I remembered fondly how it took all night to get the area spic and span, but even so, throwing that party had been totally worth it. Just to think, if it weren’t for those tiger tranquilizers, I would’ve had the clarity of mind to just shoot the leopard when it broke free from its chains and started mauling party guests. But thank god I didn’t. Otherwise, curb stomping would still be regarded as some deranged thing only real sickos do, instead of the widely accepted zoo-keeping practice it is today.</p>

2217,Genesis,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, but between you and me there was a little form and a whole lot of ocean. The Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. Just floating there about three feet in the air. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was something in his throat so he had to say it again a little louder. God saw that the light was good, and he called it “day.” The darkness he called “nort.” This was the first day. Then God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water,” and his assistant said “Ok.” And it was so, so good. Having accomplished his allotted one task per day, God declared that it was now the third day. Although he could fly, God could not swim and was embarrassed to constantly wear a lifejacket around his assistant. So he said, “Let there be dry land and green vegetation upon it. I will call this vegetation “nort.” And it was bad because he had already named something nort. For the rest of the day, God sat around trying to think of a word that wasn’t nort. After a long time he finally decided on a name for this vegetation: nort. On the fourth day, God created the sun and the moon to help keep track of time. For example, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, two-decades, and centuries. On the fifth day, God said “Let the water teem with life and let the sky teem with birds and let the water teem with sky,” forgetting the decision he had made earlier to distinguish between the sky and ocean. And he heard from a friend that it was good. On the sixth day, God brainstormed many animals and came up with fire ants, bull ants and humans. He created humans in his image and bull ants in the image of fire ants. He looked upon all his creations and saw that they were good. On the seventh day, God took rest because Sunday is the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Dear Readers,</p>

<p></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My greatest hope for you all is that you actually know how to read because this issue is full of letters and words. They aren’t hard ones, but they might require a quick peek at the<br>Scrabble dictionary. We’re talking words like love, benevolence, and lover. There may be letters involved such as g, w, and o. It won’t matter if you’ve seen these fellas before or if you’ll be sounding them out on the spot. The important thing is that you can see that we wrote some things. So just as a quick gauge of how you’ll do getting through this magazine, please tear this page out, nail it to your wall, walk six feet away, call your eye doctor, and schedule an eye exam immediately.</p>

2255,"New Partner","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cop’s #1 belief: I’m not gonna be the jerkoff that shoots his own partner. I live and breathe this mantra, and I repeated it before, during, and after shooting my five partners. Accidents happen, but the Chief isn’t so understanding, so for my next assignment he gave me Joe, a partner made of wood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What bothered me about Joe was not that he was made of wood, but that he was a newbie, fresh out of the academy. The academy doesn’t teach anything worth a damn these days, especially not how to evade bullets, as my five pardoned felonies have shown me. Also Joe was made of spruce, the meekest of woods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first night on the job we got an easy call: routine gang shooting. I got one hand on the wheel, one hand on my radio, one hand on my gun, bada-bing bada-boom before you know it I’ve shot Joe 36 times. And what did this maverick do but survive all of that and then flop out of the cruiser, his spruce frame knocking out every gang member as he fell. That’s when I knew that we’d make a good pair and that the municipality shouldn’t let me still have a gun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crimewave goes down and concussions go up. I get a custom ejector seat installed in our cruiser, so Joe can smack into ne’er-do-wells and enforce the law. It’s basically a baby seat covered in sawdust with a big spring under it – my design. Joe’s wooden torso gets covered in all sorts of medals – they really detract from his gunshot wounds. He’s gonna make a great wooden detective, maybe even chief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So pretty soon the Mrs. wants to meet Joe. He comes over, brings us a lovely casserole, but the wife isn’t expecting him to be made of wood. She loses it, screaming and running around everywhere. I shoot a look at her and some bullets at Joe. We take our meal outside, without her. Nobody disrespects him while I’m around and under federal scrutiny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask to meet Joe’s family – turns out he’s got none. He doesn’t even have a home, just spends his nights alternating between a security guard and a mannequin at this one clothing store. I try to comfort him, show him that his partner is all the family he needs. “It’s alright that you don’t have a family,” I tell him. “I probably would’ve shot them anyway.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first our relationship was just a pleasant after-school routine, like a good habit that also feels very warm. Then it quickly turned into a during-school routine, and eventually a kind of life-force.</p>

<p>When we finally made love for the first time it was horrifying, but in the strong, pleasant way like the first ride on a new horse. We had been foreplaying for months, neither of us really knowing what to do, and so constantly tying the wrong knots, mixing up the prayers and forgetting to undress at the same time. Later on, when all the candles were lit and the sex was underway, she looked at me and asked, “Why are you shaking? Don’t you trust me? I did, I realized, and that’s when I became so overwhelmed with love that my nerves trembled and my soul began ejaculating wildly as I wept. I also ejaculated in the normal way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You wake up in your high school dorm. Umaru-chan, your roommate / stepsister who is also your girlfriend, leaps down from the top bunk and nuzzles you with her cat ears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I wuv u, oniichan~” she whispers—but her eye catches the candy on your bedside table. Halfheartedly, you tell her not to eat it, but it’s too late. She gobbles it up with a ^_^ and a “Oishii desu, oniichan (very delicious, big brother!)” You bury your face in your hands; you know what’s coming next.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her body starts to swell. “W-what’s happening?” Spikes begin to poke out of her abdomen as it grows, slowly at first, and then faster and faster. Her skin, once pale, turns green, while her styled neon-green hair falls out, replaced with waxy fiber. As she expands to fill the entire room, the truth becomes shockingly clear: she is becoming a cactus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Uwu, I didn’t want to be this busty~” she whines in your direction. You groan—you don’t have time for this, you’re already late to your whimsical slice-of-life job as a typical high school student. You shake your head and turn to leave, but a call comes through on your Magicka Alarm: “Demon alert! Monster King Amaterasu has broken free from infinity prison!” You sigh—looks like that trip into the girls’ locker room will have to wait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You punch in the coordinates and roll your eyes—just your luck, he’s in the active volcano on the <em>opposite</em> side of town. As you open the door, you feel a poke from behind. You turn around to see Umaru-chan looking up at you with those big, cactusy eyes. She whispers: “Be safe, senpai~” before blushing and turning away. You smile softly to yourself and push your messy brown bangs out of your eyes. She’s a good kid. But then your expression hardens—this is no time for kids. You’re 15. You draw your weapon and, with a grumble, run there in 3 seconds with your arms behind your back (aerodynamics).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you approach, Amaterasu summons an awesome giant fire-whip from the Demon Realm, laughing at the puny dagger in your hand. Sighing, you drop it, reach into the volcano, and pull out a lava sword the size of a school bus. You leap at Amaterasu as he swings at you. Flashback: a complicated backstory. The present: you stab Amaterasu with your giant sword. He explodes into a million fox girls in tiny skirts, all of whom try to run away but immediately trip and fall over. The upbeat J-pop outro plays: ♪ ~ <em>Hātobīto de nikutai-teki ni kisushitai... (I would very like</em> <em>to physically kiss you with my heartbeat...) ~ ♫</em></p>

2429,"Advice For A New CIA Agent","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to your first day in the CIA. First of all, congratulations. If you’re an agent, you must have one of those rare faces that is completely forgettable. Normal eyes with perfectly centered pupils. Normal hair collected in a normal rattail. Really big mouth but your chin is also pretty huge so it looks normal. Ugly, but kissable. The perfect face. But to be a great CIA agent, you can’t just be good at disguising yourself. You have to be invisible. That’s why the best CIA agents are really good CIA agents who die and come back as ghosts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being a CIA agent isn’t all poisoning African dictators and throwing South American dictators out of helicopters. Sure, when the mission’s on we have to get serious, but that doesn’t mean we don’t like to hang out at the end of the day at bars and clubs, talking about how hard it is to keep secrets from our children. In fact, we like to say that most of your friends will end up being CIA agents, partly because if you make any other friends then a few weeks later we have to shoot them into space on an exploding rocket. But don’t be afraid to make friends a t the FBI, despite what you’ve heard about a rivalry. The FBI and the CIA are not in any kind of competition, unless you’re talking about the bet over who can secretly kill the most innocent Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m sure you’re wondering what you can tell your wife. You can tell her pretty much anything, except whenever you talk to her you have to do it by recording a video where you are a silhouette and you sound like a monster. You should also probably start training her now to think that blood is something else, like some kind of red rain, because sometimes you will come home with blood all over your shirt. Also, every couple weeks we call her and tell her you died, just to keep things fresh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, don’t try to be a hero and take stupid risks out there; this isn’t Mission: Impossible. Or rather, this is only like Mission: Impossible in that we can make anyone’s face into a mask.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, I have reason to believe that eight months ago this robot killed and ate my real human neighbor with the intent to spy on me and my family, and I could not let that happen. I invited him here tonight to confirm once and for all whether he was man or machine, and I did that by studying his response to a tender moment between father and daughter that would sway even the hardest of human hearts. As suspected, this robot did not even bat an eye. I apologize for scaring everyone, but you have to understand that I had to outwit that robot. Please relax and enjoy the rest of the party. Jess, I love you. Also don’t forget to- [pull out gun, shoot dentist] Everyone stay calm! That was it. That was the last robot, I promise. Take a look at his wires.

2479,"The Last Tiger's Deathbed","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a rainy night in November and at the Bronx Zoo a crowd of hundreds of thousands braved the elements to hold a candlelit vigil for Tabby, who was about to die.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tabby’s zookeeper held the noble cat’s paw as the heartbeat monitor next to the cage went “woop woop” in a weak, melancholic cadence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tabby, you sweet thing”, said the zookeeper. “Do you know how much you mean to all these people?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tigers had been extinct in the wild for so long, and all of the tigers in the zoo had gotten tired of making love. It was really sad. Tabby the tiger’s parents had been so horny, though. They were the horniest tigers ever. When Tabby was born, the hope was he would also be incredibly, incredibly horny. But he was not as horny as his parents, and he never had sex. He would die a virgin, despite throngs of people – over a billion visitors over the years—praying for him to have sex. The Pope had once held a special mass for Tabby where he got millions of Catholics to say “Please Lord, make Tabby frisky” in unison in a service broadcast all over the world. To no avail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Tabby was born he was one of five remaining tigers, including his father. His mother tragically died during childbirth, and his father was so distraught that he never fucked again. Of the three remaining tigers, only one of them was a girl. Her name was Mewy, and unfortunately she was not very horny. Mewy and Tabby shared the same cage for years, and despite the world’s foremost scientists dedicating decades of their lives to finding a way to getting them to fuck—despite there being a new genre of popular music invented where the whole point is to get these two tigers into a relaxed, horny state of mind, and this genre became huge—all of the major artists released multiple albums in the hope that it would make a difference… despite the mass prayer sessions which actually united Israel and Palestine for a couple of decades because people thought this was more important than historical differences… despite the budget the size of the GDP of Sweden spent constructing high-tech, fancy cages and also trying to clone tigers or at least make some kind of fertilizing aphrodisiac and that aphrodisiac actually did work—for humans, at least—and now impotency in humans is at least cured, but still no luck on the god damn tigers. Despite all this, and so much more, Tabby never fucked Mewy because neither of them could be bothered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Mewy died a few years later, and Bongo died a couple years after her, Tabby was the last tiger in the world.</p>

You see by the time I placed the kid in the arms of his grateful mother, I looked back and saw an even smaller, cuter, orphan boy about to be run over by the same bus! I dove in front of the bus and was able to push him away, but it was too late for me and, well, here I am.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Alright, Jesus! I heard the ice cream song and pushed some kids to the curb to get to the ice cream. I was running at a dead sprint down the road towards the truck. The driver slammed on the breaks and *<em>skkkrrrttt</em>* the truck came to a stop inches from my face—the momentum of the stop propelled the oversized ice cream cone on the top of the truck forward and the cone impaled me through the skull and I died there on the street.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Psssst. Hey kids. Yeah you guys. Looking for a good time? I could help you out with some purchases which might make your night more… interesting. What’s that? You want me to buy you beer? Sure, I can uh… I can do that. After all, I'm just a normal guy sitting outside a liquor store with a boombox ready to blast some classic rock. The play button’s right here. Not interested? That’s fine, I’ll be right back with the alcohol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Say, not to invade your privacy, but what are you planning on doing with all these beers? You’re going to drink them? Nice. Personally, I like to drink my beers and then sit down, but what do you do? Do you like to move around after you drink beer, maybe in time with a rhythm? Oh, you also like to sit down. That’s cool. Look at us, two sit down beer drinkers over here! Maybe we should celebrate by listening to some classic rock? Still not interested? No problem, I got your beers right here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you go, is there anything else I can help you with? If you want, I could teach you some dance moves and give you a few CDs, if that’s the kind of thing you’re into. Yeah I know what cocaine is. You’re asking if I have any? Maybe, but I was hoping to save it for myself. Yeah, you’re right, 87mg does sound like a weird number. Sure, I’ll round you up to an even hundred.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there a big party going on tonight? Something that a fella like me could <em>jam out </em>to if you know what I mean? I see, you guys are just going to hang out and have a bonfire.

<p>Stockton takes the ball up. Keeping his distance from Jordan. Agreed, Herb, probably the stench, Herb. And Jordan’s projectile vomit stream SLAPS the ball out of Stockton’s hands! It’s Bulls’ ball as the ref himself starts to yak.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Jordan continues to hurl. Vomits left. Dishes to Pippen. Pippen wipes his hands on his jersey after touching the ball. You said it, Herb: soaked. Jordan uttering something that is not English.

<p>Quick pants-piss from each ref, and we’re back in action.&nbsp; Utah will inbound and Jordan STEALS the ball with his words. The ball POPS upon Jordan’s hot touch. You don’t see that often, Herb. Apologies to the viewers for the chunkblow noises-- Herb himself is now drawn in by MJ’s spell of darkness. MJ breathes some flies between sips of Gatorade. Karl Malone’s son, now dead in the stands. Ooooh, and a SILKY mid-range jumper from Pippen.</p>

2497,"Change Jar","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>i am texting from the faculty lounge and i am looking at the Change Jar in front of me and it appears as empty as my third marriage was. I know it is not a Jar but a coffee cup featuring our school mascot the one that we are trying to get rid of the ""so called "" ""Rocket Rabbit"". as you'll recall we decided at the faculty meeting that the Rocket Rabbit was inappropriate because he does not consent to the rocket nowhere in the image does he say ""I AM THE ROCKET RABBIT I CONSENT TO THE ROCKET"". someone else also brought up that the Rocket Rabbit is actually riding the Space Shuttle Columbia which blew up in 1981. but we decided that Rocket Rabbit could killl himself as long as the image showed him clearly signing a notarized consent form in a country where euthanasia is legal. when we considered a new mascot Juan proposed Charles Manson the founder of our ITT Technical High School. Charles Manson was one of the first technologists in Peoria and built the first computer powered by top hats in 1901. we've been telling our students for years to pay attention to top hats nobody was talking about them but w hoever unlocked them would be the next Bill Gates. we were so convinced Charles Manson should be our new mascot that we renamed the school into Charles Manson High School right on the spot. we passed the changes unanimously but then the Budget Chairman stood out of his fine leather chair. ""We only have one bag of gold coins"" he said dropping a sack of gold coins onto the table while adjusting his monocle. ""We need two bags of gold coins for the costs associated with switching mascots."" Of course we worked at a cash strapped public school because we believed in the mission that one of the kids would get rich and buy us a house. so we decided to eliminate the textbook budget, and fill in the rest of the gap with a faculty Change Jar. BUT SOMEONE JUST TOOK EVERY RED CENT OUT OF THAT CHANGE JAR (COFFEE CUP) AND HA S NOW ROBBED OUR CHILDREN OF CHARLES MANSON. there was $20.21 in thatJar or about 40% of our annual public school teacher's salary. so i hope whatever the thief bought with the stloen money was worth our children's future. Charles Manson is up in heaven right thinking of magnificent ways to use top hats while you corrupt his his legacy . i googled Charles Manson the other day and it said he lived in California for a while but i didnt finish the article because my fourth wife needed me to cosign her self assisted suicide forms and i also just hate reading beacuse i just like to watch the Harry Potter movie.&nbsp;</p>

2502,"Dandelion Tales","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heineken in one hand and <em>Paradise Lost</em> essay in the other, Dandelion cruised down Lafayette at a cool 35—just half of his electric skateboard’s top speed. Yeah, he was late for class; he liked it better that way. Time was Dandelion’s undercooked meringue, and he was always happy to serve. Need a fork? Not if you’ve got a spoon, buddy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dandelion banked the corner onto Malvern and parked his ’board next to a peach tree, no lock. No one would dare touch it, and even if they did, like hell anyone could schride better than Dandy Boy. He reached a sinewy hand up to the branches and pulled down the juiciest peach you ever saw. He brought it to his face, puckered his lips, and sucked out the pit. Much too sour. He spat it onto the ground—34 yards, just three short of his record. Dandelion howled with glee.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dandelion sauntered into class, all lanyards and car keys and cigarettes, and sat down in the front row (though I wouldn’t call it sitting the way you or I know it, not with that dancing fever he had burning up his legs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, Dandy, nice of you to join us today.” Professor Strauss’ voice crackled with that bubbling rage cultivated in every house-broken bozo who found themselves within Dandelion’s range. Dandelion, for his part, just smiled back with that same dopey grin. He pulled the Tootsie sucker out of his mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Gee, is it today already? I’ll have to tell the missus.” <em>Zinger.</em> Dandy leaned way back in his chair and cracked a lopsided smile as he popped the sucker back in. He bathed in his forever moment—aplomb, cherry-flavored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strauss, to his credit, tried to reply, “Dandy, you—”, but it was later than late. Class was long<em> </em>over. Dandy was through the door before the bell rang. His seat, still rocking with the memory of its guest, lay trembling for Dandelion’s tomorrow. In it sat merely the imprint of that Golden Boy and a John Milton essay—an essay with scribbles written in Strauss’ own hand, shakily, hastily, weightily, begrudgingly across the top: A++.</p>

2573,"Inventing the Wheel","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you… the wheel!&nbsp;<em>(Roaring applause)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just what exactly does it do, you ask? Buddy let me tell you. The better question is: what can’t it do? For instance, it can’t be used to farm, or hunt, or gather. It’s also really hard to build with because it’s so round… Buuuuut, you can do this:&nbsp;<em>(rolls wheel down small hill).</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Incredible! Just think of all the practical applications. If we ever needed to, uhhh, maybe if there was a hill and at the bottom we had some uhhh, enemies. Then this wheel, I mean, it probably won’t kill them or anything, but they’ll be a little distracted for sure. And while they’re distracted you can hit them with another wheel! Or maybe if we had some kind of device to shoot a sharp thing at them you could do that? Like, a curved stick with some string or something. We could call it the sharpinator. Yeah, the sharpinator, I like the sound of that. That’d be pretty great, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We already have that? It’s called a bow and arrow? Pretty lame name, but I guess that’s cool. Goes great with the wheel, just like I said. Honestly, I’m not sure you can call yourself a warrior if<br>you don’t have one. A wheel, that is. Also the bow and arrow.</p>

2583,"How Cancer Eventually Got Cured","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you say anything, we know what you’re thinking: why should you care that cancer<br>eventually got cured when in Key Largo, Florida, there’s an underwater hotel that delivers<br>dry pizza and no one knows how they do it? Well if you were the one who had cancer, you’d<br>be whistling a different tune.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>That aside, good point—and, believe it or not, before he cured cancer Craig was actually an<br>underwater pizza-guy at Key Largo himself. In many ways, it was just like being a regular<br>pizza-guy: he took the orders, picked his nose, and was at no point given a scuba by Boss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Why did Craig keep working there without a scuba, you ask? Well, some of us have children<br>to feed. Not Craig: he just got a big high from swimming really fast to deliver dry pizzas.<br>Also the work culture. Craig couldn’t help but crack a smile every time our beepers belted<br>“where’s my fucking pizza?”, a little chorus that Boss enjoyed screaming in funny voices to<br>cheer us on as we swam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Despite all the fun we were having with Craig, his 251st pizza would turn out to be his<br>last. All pizzas had to be delivered dry, and Craig took a shit on that one—liquid. “That<br>oughta give these capitalists a taste of their own poop,” we thought, since indeed their poop<br>probably tasted just like Craig’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Yeah, that’s right—we’re all just human. And at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how<br>many pizzas you shit on. Because, one day, death and early retirement come for all of us.<br>And sure, both come sooner if you’re Craig, delivering underwater pizza at Key Largo. But<br>there was nothing anyone could do about that, which is why Craig eventually cured cancer<br>instead—and boy did we cheer for our boy Craig.</p>

<p>If you would’ve told me yesterday that I’d be writing an obituary for the guy in this photo, I would’ve had a lot of questions. Who is the guy? Where’d he get that funny little cigarette? Wait, now he’s dead? If he’s dead then who took the photo? He did? Excuse me, now? When the guy from this photo died and no one came to claim obituary rights, I knew it was time for me to step up and tell his story, whatever it may be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember the first time I looked at that photo of the man with the little cigarette. He chewed on it to make me laugh, because of how it was a funny thing to do. Man, we were so innocent back then. By we, I mean America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can tell a lot about a man from the way he takes photos of himself chewing on funny little cigarettes. I bet this guy did it a lot, with his mouth, with his teeth. Maybe even some tongue. I’d like to think if we were friends, you know, before he died, he would’ve offered me a cigarette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would’ve looked at him in his dark green/perhaps yellow eyes with what I would’ve considered average size pupils most-likely and said “no, cigarettes are for poor people, hicks, and the downtrodden metrosexual.” He wouldn’t have taken offense to that. No, no, he was from a different time. A time when he was alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ha, maybe it’s just me getting all emotional from the fumes coming off the funny cigarette guy’s body, but I think he may have had to die so all of us could come together. I’m sorry---I don’t mean to make this about Trump. This should be about the guy who used to sit in his car in one of his classic black t-shirts, wearing one of his handsome baseball caps, doing the dirty with a little<br>gag cigarette so we could all have a laugh from him. Man, I bet he was such a good guy. I bet he had a guy name, like Darryl or C9-F@$5. I wonder if he liked television. I wonder if he knew about the radio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damn, I sure would’ve liked to tell him these things if he was alive. Which he is not.</p>

<p>The janitor was diligently color-coding dust when the director burst in. “Mort, none of the actors showed up. We need you to be King Lear.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mort, who rarely opened his mouth except to smoke and second-hand smoke, was taken aback. “You tellin’ me’s I’s got to play broads’s and blokes’s? You tellin’ me’s I’s gotta express themes of political complexity’s whilst juggling vocals of every range?”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a tall order, but Mort took it with the easy swagger he had since his family died in a similarly brazen theatrical challenge. Some say the facade of casual confidence hid what was deep inside: incomprehensibly extreme confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Just tell me where’s I gotta stand and what’s I’s gotta do and you won’t hear no complaining from me,” Mort mumbled, having unconsciously walked on stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You know’s what I hate’s most about’s the New York Metro?” He asks the crowd. The audience is mesmerized, having never seen a more working class man. Mort chose to leave that question rhetorical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mort turns out his pockets.&nbsp; “See’s? More nickels than’s quarters just like’s I thought.” Confident he’s nailing it with just about anything, he struggles to parse the lyrics to “Seventy Six Trombones.” “Don’t help’s me!” He warns the audience, who try to chip in.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The play ended as abruptly as Mort’s intermittent smoke breaks had started. The lights turned back on, revealing a stunned Simon Cowell. “Mort, you son of a bitch,” he said, starting a slow clap that spread through the audience. Mort brushed it off with a few “yeah yeah’s” and returned to playing with his dusts.<br>The director was desperate. “Mort, please, for the love of God. Go out there. Be Somebody. Anything Mort. Please, they want, no, <em>need </em>more.” Mort gave the director a look he saved only for his ma and passing cattle. “Little ol’ me? Wheezy ol’ janitor Mort who ain’t’s never up to nothin’? Get real boss. I don’t’s even know’s the difference between’s a jack pipe and’s a dweller receiver pipe.” Then Mort grinned. He knew the difference all too well.</p>

<p>It’s the first day at Romance Academy. A new student introduces herself to you: Mitzi, eighteen, giggles when she talks. Behind you, Mrs. Cupid (no relation) puts up a poster for the Back to School Dance. Outside, the cherry blossoms fall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Aww, you’re so sweet! I’m going with my boyfriend Armando, though.” She gestures at a strapping young man doing push-ups. The bell rings, signaling the start of Romance Class.</p>

<p>You sit down. Jasmin, your best friend, puts a hand on your shoulder. “Hey,” she whispers. “That took a lot of guts.” You’ve known her since childhood, but today you see her in a different light. Outside, the cherry blossoms bloom into cherry trees. Now’s your chance.</p>

<p>“I’d love to! But I already promised Armando I’d go with him.” You mention he’s going with Mitzi. Jasmin tells you it’s fine, they’ve talked it out, and Armando’s very secure. You look at Armando. He’s doing tricep dips in his chair while writing poetry. Mrs. Cupid shouts your name, and you snap to attention. “For the last time,” she says, “what is the secret to love?”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone leaves the room. Mrs. Cupid takes off her glasses and lets down her hair. “You’re not learning as much about love as I’d hoped. I might have to teach you… one on one.” She leans in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> <strong>     > lean in</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She opens her eyes. “I’m sorry,” she says, “I thought you were Armando.” The door bursts open. “Yo, Mrs. C!” Armando walks in, followed by a flock of adoring girls. “Armando needs some extra credit!” That line’s so cool. He’s so cool. He and Mrs. Cupid kiss with tongue. Outside, the cherry blossoms grow higher than ever before.</p>

<p><em>For our upcoming issue, we asked some Lampoon subscribers to write in to share stories about times they got revenge on someone. Here are some classic get-even moments from some of our fans.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“One time at University my mates and I let a real live Breton horse into our meanest professor’s office! I’ll never forget the look on his face when he walked in and saw the mare trotting around his desk.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""right""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-right"">-<strong>Winston (78), Westfield.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I had a girl who was so mean to me in class all through middle school, so on the last day of class before Christmas break I tied her hair to her chair. When she tried to get up she fell down, taking the whole desk with her! Everyone called her Pigtail Patty for the rest of the year, until her wealthy/affluent parents paid us to stop.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""right""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-right"">-<strong>Cheryl (16), New York City.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a look of paralyzing fear. Apparently as a child he lost his father in a horse-riding accident and hadn’t been around one since. He sank to the floor, clutching his chest. Turns out this wasn’t his first heart attack.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""right""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-right"">-<strong>Winston (78), Westfield.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He died later that day, but not before the mounted police arrived to apprehend the horse. I had never seen so many horses in such a small office space. I wish I had taken a picture of the whole mess. Once the officer opened fire we knew the prank was one to remember.” </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""right""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-right"">-<strong>Winston (78), Westfield.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It started as a battle of police versus horse, but soon there were no sides, only screaming. A horse doesn’t scream like a man. No, it’s a lower growl of terrified pain and brunt confusion. I hope I never have to hear the sound again, although I’m sure I will. I’m sure we all will, once the equestrian breed realizes its captivity is an illusion backed-up by historical precedent, not true manpower. No, horses have the strength as well as the dominant physical makeup, and when they realize it I’m afraid it will be too late for us all. I fear we won’t last the century. Also, please stop mailing the Lampoon to my house. I cancelled my subscription 30 years ago.</p>

2725,"Driving a Plane","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I’m driving a plane down the highway, airport control radio crackles in, “Unit 332, you left&nbsp; the tarmac. Are you airborne?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No,” I reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a beautiful day for a plane drive. The sun is shining, none of the passengers are screaming&nbsp; yet, and there’s no traffic. Most people fly planes because there’s less traffic in the sky. I drive&nbsp; one because it only takes several hours longer <em>and</em> you don’t need a license.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A drive-thru! Yet another thing they don’t have in the sky. I signal to change lanes, and open up&nbsp; the emergency chute instead. I keep forgetting planes aren’t designed for roads. Now, I have to&nbsp; change lanes and avoid all the passengers that just fell out. Luckily I’m a good driver and planes&nbsp; have small, easily avoidable, wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sadly, planes have wings and this drive-thru is not wing-accessible. Row F is going to be so&nbsp; angry—I promised them a burger for winning license plate bingo. So I hand out some peanuts&nbsp; and pretzels and tell ‘em they’re plane burgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I intercept a trucker signal.&nbsp; “Avoid Route 9. Some idiot’s sledding in a plane”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a little offended because I’m on Route 9, and the only one in a plane. Maybe my wheels fell&nbsp; off, but I’m clearly driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like to think of plane wheels as training wheels. Without them, we’re really driving. This&nbsp; can-do attitude is what keeps me driving planes. It also helps that if anyone cuts me off I can run&nbsp; them over and win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re headed towards a body of water. Which is good because I was planning on a water landing&nbsp; anyway. Plus, I stopped being able to steer when the wheels fell off. Fortunately, there’s enough&nbsp; time for the passengers to put on their life jackets and swimsuits. Plus the emergency chute looks&nbsp; kind of like a waterslide if you turn your head and shut your eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personally, I think “Hero” is a strong word. Sure, I got everyone out of the plane and into the&nbsp; hospital alive, but it’s what I do every Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good evening passengers, this is your doctor speaking. Yeah, you heard that right. Everybody knows that the only thing harder than pilot school is doctor school. That’s why I didn’t go to either. At the end of the day it’s just a bunch of buttons. And flying a plane? How hard can that be?</p>

At the very least I know we’re not over the ocean because that is the one place I absolutely can not go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of you are suffering from appendicitis, and the rest of you are here for weight-balancing purposes. I’ll start the procedures once we get out of this turbulence and into some stronger turbulence, because I can tell you now this stuff is not nearly strong enough to cancel out the Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>If you haven’t gotten the complimentary nuts yet, they’re probably not coming. This is a Turkish Airlines plane I stole in Baghdad so I highly doubt any of the attendants speak English. Come to think of it, you guys probably don’t speak English either. Crazy how language works like that.</p>

<p>Of course I have a girlfriend, she just goes to another school. Which school? The, uh, the one a few blocks north of here. That’s the school for the blind? Really? Uh, yeah, that one.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, yeah, we’ve gone on tons of dates. In fact, we just drove to that spot where all the couples hook up. Make...kiss...out...creek? Point? Sorry, I just go there so many times I forget the name. Then we looked at the stars before we did kissing a lot. Yeah, she wanted to stargaze even though she’s blind, she doesn’t define herself by her limitations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, you can’t find her online, she doesn’t have a computer. She’s not allowed to have electricity, even. Not after what she did. Yeah, dropped a hair dryer in the public pool, shut the whole place down. Really messed some people up, one guy had a pacemaker. News didn’t cover it because my dad paid them off. He owns Nintendo, I told you this already. Anyway she would probably love to text me right now but she can’t because of the thing I just said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t worry about the pool thing, some people made it out okay. But like no one pressed charges so that’s all that matters. This is why I never tell anything to you guys. You hear one detail and you blow everything out of proportion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay fine, you got me, I don’t have a blind girlfriend. I’m just embarrassed because my real girlfriend goes to a school in Canada where she does modeling. </p>

<p><strong>Teacher: </strong>Greg, could you open discussion on the theme of villainy in <em>Great Expectations</em>? <br><strong>Greg: </strong>Well...there are of course a few people that could be considered criminals in the book. <strong>Teacher: </strong>A few criminals? Most, actually all, literary critics would disagree. Please elaborate. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>I think I take it back. There are no criminals in this book? <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>Greg, you’ve hooked me, but use the fishing rod of knowledge to enlighten me further. <strong>Greg: </strong>You know, how do we define criminal, and who in the book really meets this definition? <strong>Teacher: </strong>My interpretation is that we meet a character pretty early on that committed murder. <strong>Greg: </strong>I don’t think we really know this character at this point. I certainly don’t. <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>At this point in the book you mean. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>Yes? Yes. <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>It might help if you name that criminal I was referring to and tell us what you mean. <strong>Amanda: </strong>It’s pretty clear that Greg can’t name this criminal, nor has he read the book. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>We could sit here and indict every character in the book as a “criminal” or “murderer” if we really wanted to. You’d know that if <em>you </em>read the book, Amanda. <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>Then it seems, to teach Amanda, you can name any character in the book, Greg. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>....So it would seem. <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>Then go ahead and name any character in the book. Name one character. <br><strong>Amanda: </strong>Oh come on. The author names four non-criminal characters on the first page, Greg. <strong>Teacher: </strong>It seems Amanda would better understand your analysis if you named the author. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>Katherine Evans. <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>That’s my name, Greg. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>Right, right. Just addressing you directly when I say that the author is Charles Dickens, or so the cover of the book would have us believe. <br><strong>Teacher: </strong>(<em>Smiling</em>) You see, Amanda. If you listen, you can learn a lot from others’ readings, like I have from Greg today. Good job, Greg. Amanda, I have nothing more to say to you. <br><strong>Amanda: </strong>This is unbelievable. Greg contributed absolutely nothing to today’s discussion. <br><strong>Greg: </strong>You’re right. The characters were today’s real contributors. The criminal and the other characters. That is if there were others.</p>

<p><em>We’ve all been there, Gam-gam’s down for the count and you’re tongue-tied. Read below for my top tips!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Hey man, I’m really sorry. I can’t imagine what you’re going through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- The same thing happened to my grandmother. She died, that is. It probably hurt less.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- I’m really am sorry, though. You know that, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Accidents happen in construction sites all the time. And I thought it was a construction site. I really did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- If it makes you feel any better, it was a miracle I wasn’t harmed. ATVs are one of the most dangerous vehicles, and we only had child-sized helmets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Think for a second about how stupid <em>I</em> feel right now? I’ve just lost a dear friend as well. That’s right, your grandma and I actually got along really well. We may have even kissed once or twice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- I was just kidding man, we never kissed. She didn’t want to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Hey, I’ll go and get my ATV license right now. No bribes this time, promise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- I’m sure your grandma’s looking down right now and saying <em>you should forgive your best friend in the whole wide world, because he’s very sorry, and also you should lend him twenty bucks for his ATV test</em>. I think you should listen to her, man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- I love you too, man. I’ve always got your back, and there’s always space on the ATV for one more. Not legally, of course. But when has that ever stopped us before?</p>
